    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>A golang web app tutorial</h3>

<p>I did some work with <a href="http://golang.org/">Google Go</a> recently and had the chance to follow their great tutorial <em><a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/">Writing Web Applications</a></em>. The tutorial is pretty simple: use the Go http library to create a very simple wiki-style site. I like this tutorial a lot because there&rsquo;s not too much hand-holding, but they do eventually hand you the <a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/final.go">final code listing</a>. Then the good people at Google give you the tall task of completing the following &lsquo;Other tasks&rsquo; without solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/.</li>
<li>Add a handler to make the web root redirect to /view/FrontPage.</li>
<li>Spruce up the page templates by making them valid HTML and adding some CSS rules.</li>
<li>Implement inter-page linking by converting instances of [PageName] to
&lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://larryprice.github.io/view/PageName">http://larryprice.github.io/view/PageName</a>&rdquo;>PageName&lt;/a>. (hint: you could use regexp.ReplaceAllFunc to do this)</li>
</ul>


<p>This is what I&rsquo;d like to go over. I scoured the web and didn&rsquo;t have much luck finding solutions to these issues. That would be okay if they were all trivial, but the final step is not straightforward. I&rsquo;m going to assume you&rsquo;ve already gone over the tutorial. You can see <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/">my repository on Github</a>, and I have included links to the appropriate commits in the code sections of this blog post.</p>

<h4>Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/</h4>

<p>The tutorial originally has the developer store all pages in the project directory. Every time a user made a new wiki page, a new file would creep into the project directory. All HTML templates were also stored in the project directory.</p>

<p>Moving templates is quite trivial. In the global scope:</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/9994d11b5275bc5faee911e5db2c994bc91052e2
-var templates = template.Must(template.ParseFiles("edit.html", "view.html"))
+var templates = template.Must(template.ParseFiles("tmpl/edit.html", "tmpl/view.html"))
</code></p>

<p>I found moving the page data to <code>data/</code> was a little trickier, especially if the directory didn&rsquo;t already exist. You may not have the same issue, but I remedied this by creating the directory if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. My <code>save</code> function differences:</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/e86a707d37b802b2d59b8ef261b3fdcab46d5870
func (p *Page) save() error {
-    filename := p.Title + ".txt"
-    return ioutil.WriteFile(filename, p.Body, 0600)
+  os.Mkdir("data", 0777)
+  filename := "data/" + p.Title + ".txt"
+  return ioutil.WriteFile(filename, p.Body, 0600)
}
</code></p>

<h4>Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/</h4>

<p>All we&rsquo;re going to do is create a simple handler called <code>rootHandler</code> that redirects to a new page called <code>FrontPage</code>. We then add it in the <code>main</code> function. The tutorial had us wrap out handlers in a function call to take some special actions, but that wrapper would mess up our handler in its current form. So I just <code>Redirect</code> to the <code>view</code> handler, which will then decide whether to view or create the FrontPage.</p>

<p>``` diff wiki.go <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/e41fccc2d244a3b0d62d600d94897a076c87d53d">https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/e41fccc2d244a3b0d62d600d94897a076c87d53d</a>
+ func rootHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
+   http.Redirect(w, r, &ldquo;/view/FrontPage&rdquo;, http.StatusFound)
+ }</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>func main() {
+  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/&rdquo;, rootHandler)
  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/view/&rdquo;, makeHandler(viewHandler))
  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/edit/&rdquo;, makeHandler(editHandler))
  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/save/&rdquo;, makeHandler(saveHandler))
```</p>

<h4>Spruce up the page templates by making them valid HTML and adding some CSS rules.</h4>

<p>I took my old <code>.html</code> files and put them through <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">a validator</a>. Making them valid only involved adding <code>DOCTYPE</code>, <code>html</code>, and <code>head</code> tags. The <code>head</code> tag needed <code>meta</code>, and <code>title</code> tags and we were valid. I&rsquo;ve shown <code>view.html</code> below.</p>

<p>``` diff view.html <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/771b4ecc8a550ee438720dc5c3d3f47954a1e4ff">https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/771b4ecc8a550ee438720dc5c3d3f47954a1e4ff</a>
+&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
+<html>
+<head>
+<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

 <h1></h1></p>

<p> <p>[<a href="http://larryprice.github.io/edit/">edit</a>]</p></p>

<p> <div></div>
+</html>
```</p>

<h4>Implement inter-page linking by converting instances of [PageName]</h4>

<p>Converting [PageName] to a hyperlink was a bit more complicated than expected. I originally just tried to run the string through <code>ReplaceAllFunc</code> and replace all instance of [PageName] with an equivalent hyperlink. This does not work because we use Go&rsquo;s <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> method to render our template. <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> escapes any HTML that we give it to prevent us from displaying unwanted HTML. Getting around this was the fun part, because I want the benefit of escaped HTML while still having the ability to substitute my own HTML.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> will not escape variables of the type <code>template.HTML</code>. So I added another variable onto the <code>Page</code> struct called <code>DisplayBody</code>.</p>

<p>``` diff wiki.go <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288">https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288</a>
type Page struct {</p>

<pre><code> Title string
 Body  []byte
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li> DisplayBody template.HTML
}
```</li>
</ul>


<p>Next, I create a regular expression to find instances of [PageName] and I put the defintion above the <code>main</code> method.</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288
+var linkRegexp = regexp.MustCompile("\\[([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\\]")
</code></p>

<p>In my <code>viewHandler</code>, I escape <code>Body</code> and then set <code>DisplayBody</code> to that escaped string with the links substituted.</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288
+  escapedBody := []byte(template.HTMLEscapeString(string(p.Body)))
+
+  p.DisplayBody = template.HTML(linkRegexp.ReplaceAllFunc(escapedBody, func(str []byte) []byte {
+      matched := linkRegexp.FindStringSubmatch(string(str))
+      out := []byte("&lt;a href=\"/view/"+matched[1]+"\"&gt;"+matched[1]+"&lt;/a&gt;")
+      return out
+    }))
  renderTemplate(w, "view", p)
}
</code></p>

<p>To finish up, I modify the <code>view.html</code> to show <code>DisplayBody</code>. I don&rsquo;t use <code>printf</code>, because that would turn <code>DisplayBody</code> back into a <code>string</code> and <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> would escape it.</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288
-&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></p>

<p>And that completes the extra exercises for Google&rsquo;s <em>Writing Web Applications</em> tutorial. Hopefully one day this helps someone who gets stuck.</p>

    <link href="http://larryprice.github.io/blog/2013/08/31/using-foreman-to-create-an-upstart-service/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-31T17:05:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://larryprice.github.io/blog/2013/08/31/using-foreman-to-create-an-upstart-service</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished my first attempt at deploying a web app to run automatically in the background on a friend&rsquo;s server. Pretty easy, really. The first thing I did was install <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a>. Assuming you have ruby and rubygems installed:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo gem install foreman
</code></p>

<p>Next I needed to give foreman the commands to start my app. I created a file in the root of my project directory called &lsquo;Procfile&rsquo; and gave it the steps I would run to start my app manually. For the sake of simplicity, let&rsquo;s say I run my app pretty barebones:</p>

<p><code>bash Procfile
web: bundle exec rackup
</code></p>

<p>Now when I run <code>foreman start</code>, foreman will use <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> to execute rackup with the correct gems in my Gemfile. Now exporting upstart config files is pretty easy.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo foreman export upstart --app=MyApp --user=root /etc/init
</code></p>

<p>That command creates the .conf files needed for upstart to control the service called &lsquo;MyApp&rsquo; as the user &lsquo;root.&rsquo; It puts all the .conf files in <code>/etc/init</code> (which is where Ubuntu puts such things) and will create a default log directory in <code>/var/log/MyApp</code>. Now I can control my service by running <code>service MyApp start</code>, <code>service MyApp stop</code>, <code>service MyApp restart</code>, and <code>service MyApp status</code>. Hooray for me.</p>

<p>But I need to run my app in two ways: in dev mode on a local port with my dev database, and I need to run it in production mode using port 80 and the production database. I&rsquo;ve also heard that using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEBrick">webrick</a> (the default server installed with rackup) is great for develpment, but I should be using something else for my production server. So I made some config files for foreman:</p>

<p><code>bash development.env
RACK_ENV=development
PORT=9292
SERVER=rackup
</code></p>

<p><code>bash production.env
RACK_ENV=production
PORT=80
SERVER=unicorn
</code></p>

<p>And I change my Procfile to:</p>

<p><code>bash Procfile
web: bundle exec $SERVER -p $PORT -E $RACK_ENV
</code></p>

<p>Ridiculously configured. Now when I run <code>foreman start</code>, it will error out. I need to specify my environment file:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ foreman start -e production.env
</code></p>

<p>Now foreman will use Bundler to startup the server specified in <code>$SERVER</code>, run the app on port <code>$PORT</code> (-p), and will pass through the environment listed as <code>$RACK_ENV</code> to my application (-E), allowing my app to do whatever configuration it does given the current environment. Power to the people.</p>

<p><a href="http://michaelvanrooijen.com/articles/2011/06/08-managing-and-monitoring-your-ruby-application-with-foreman-and-upstart/">I found that this guy</a> does a lot more complicated stuff with Foreman, if you need more.</p>

    <link href="http://larryprice.github.io/blog/2013/08/26/on-the-futility-of-man-and-trying-to-divide-a-sinatra-app-into-separate-controllers/"/>

    <id>http://larryprice.github.io/blog/2013/08/26/on-the-futility-of-man-and-trying-to-divide-a-sinatra-app-into-separate-controllers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh, <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. You&rsquo;re oh-so-very dear to me. You made it so easy for me to write my <a href="http://capitalpunishment.herokuapp.com">first</a> <a href="http://pokephile.herokuapp.com">web</a> apps. All I had to do was write a couple routes and throw together a few HTML-like files and I had a web app. I used pattern matching to reduce the web-facing code for <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/CapitalPunishment">Capital Punishment</a> from ~500 lines of code to &lt;100 lines of code. You are perfect for writing small-time web applications.</p>

<p>But what about large web applications? What about a web app that has normal users and admin users, makes lots of database reads and writes (my previous apps only did reads from a user-facing perspective), and has to be able to show the history of everything, forever, to the authorized users who request it?</p>

<p>You see, Sinatra is kind of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC framework</a>, but not exactly. In Sinatra, you have Views (your HTML inter-mixed with Ruby code in your desired DSL) and you have Controllers (each of your routes). When a database is involved, you can use something like <a href="https://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra-activerecord">ActiveRecord</a> or <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html">Mongoid</a> or <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> and you have yourself Models.</p>

<p>So every route is kind of a Controller. Every. Route. In Capital Punishment, there were once 8 routes (there are now 7). In the project I&rsquo;ve been working on recently, there are currently 56 routes. 56 routes in the language described above means I kind of have 56 controllers.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been pretty overwhelming, especially since the traditional way of creating routes in Sinatra is to shove them all in the same file. There are a few ways I could think of to address this. The way we chose six months ago (for better or worse) was found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5877000/what-is-a-controller-in-sinatra">on StackOverflow</a>, and involves creating a bunch of different files where you shove all related routes. So you get this situation:</p>

<p>``` ruby app.rb
class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
end</p>

<p>require_relative &lsquo;controllers/helpers&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dir.glob(&ldquo;#{File.dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>)}/controllers/*.rb&rdquo;).each do |file|
  require file.chomp(File.extname(file))
end</p>

<p>class App
  get &lsquo;/&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>erb :home
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>``` ruby controllers/reports_controller.rb
class App
  get &lsquo;/reports/user_bills&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>erb :user_bills_report
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  &hellip;
end
```</p>

<p>And so on and so forth. This works fine for a while, but we&rsquo;ve ended up with 13 &ldquo;controller&rdquo; files, many of which are not trivial. This also makes the App class quite large since its controllers handle most of the logic for the app. This also doesn&rsquo;t enforce any kind of URL-naming logic, so if a developer is working hard (s)he may create both <code>/reports/user_bills</code> and <code>user_info_reports</code> without realizing the inconsistency (s)he just injected into the system.</p>

<p>In hindsight, this method is not perfect. I think that the Rails method of individual controllers is significantly better for large apps. Some people have been using other methods for trying to make Sinatra more MVC, such as <a href="https://github.com/jorrizza/sinatra-mvc">sinatra-mvc</a>. To be frank, sinatra-mvc pretty much does the same thing we&rsquo;ve done, but with more structure.</p>

<p>I think what I&rsquo;ve learned is that you should use a tool for its intended purpose. Sinatra was written to quickly create web apps in Ruby with minimal effort. Once you have more than 10-15 routes, you should reconsider whether your app can still be called &ldquo;minimal effort.&rdquo; Sinatra may fly you to the moon, but you&rsquo;re unlikely to see what spring is like on Jupiter or Mars.</p>

    <id>http://larryprice.github.io/blog/2012/10/19/a-hacky-solution-to-the-unicode-data-in-a-unicode-only-collation-problem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Issue Rises <a id="problem"></a></h2>

<p>Earlier this week a defect was found in my application. A defect that I could have sworn I fixed several weeks ago and written about in a <a href="http://nullablevoid.blogspot.com/2012/10/unicode-data-in-unicode-only-collation.html">previous blog post</a>. Let me start from the beginning:</p>

<h4>The Setup</h4>

<p>The application is a web app using Rails 3.2, MSSQL Server for the database, and Tiny-TDS for database communications from the CloudFoundry server. There are three different types of builds and three databases I access: development (for development, obviously), staging (for testing), and production (for the users to complain about, mostly).</p>

<h4>The Original Issue</h4>

<p>I inherited this code and ran it on my dev build with no issues. Upon doing some testing with the staging build, the page crashed. The logs revealed the following (horrible) error:</p>

<p><code>ruby Vague error
Unicode data in a Unicode-only collation or ntext data cannot be sent to clients using DB-Library (such as ISQL) or ODBC version 3.7 or earlier.
</code></p>

<p>What does this mean? Well. Beats me. <a href="http://dirk.net/2010/09/18/sql-server-with-freetds-unicode-data-error/">Several</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5414890/mssql-query-issue-in-php-and-querying-text-data">sources</a> had <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8705008/tiny-tds-error-on-heroku-connecting-to-sqlserver-db">similar</a> <a href="http://findyourscript.com/index.php/2011/05/20/unicode-data-in-a-unicode-only-collation-or-ntext-data-cannot-be-sent-to-clients-using-db-library/">issues</a> and the ones I liked eventually came to the conclusion that ntext and nvarchar variables in the database were ticking off the host server. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186939.aspx">Apparently</a>, text variables are translated to nvarchar(MAX), where MAX is something like 2GB of data. I hunted through my database and, sure enough, the &lsquo;Narrative&rsquo; column was an nvarchar(MAX).</p>

<h4>The Original Fix</h4>

<p>Based on the mighty power of the internet, I decided that the best thing for me to do was to change the variable in the database from a &ldquo;text&rdquo; to a &ldquo;string&rdquo; with a limit of 8000 (which translates to varchar(8000)) using this migration:</p>

<p>``` ruby Simple migration
class ChangeNarrativeColumnToVarChar &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change</p>

<pre><code>change_column :evaluation, :narrative, :string, :limit =&gt; 8000
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>I ran through my repro steps and&hellip; Drumroll&hellip; Suspense&hellip; It worked! Or so it appeared. I went to the narrative textbox and put some words in it, saved, and confirmed that everything was great. Then I pushed it to production and heard nothing for two weeks.</p>

<h2>Failure Is Always An Option <a id="failure"></a></h2>

<p>Too bad that wasn&rsquo;t the end of the story. This week my users finally started using the app again. They found all kinds of defects, of course, but one in particular that caught me off guard: When viewing the narrative text, which we had &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; using that little migration above, the text cut off to about two lines. Two lines? I never really bothered to test more than a couple words or a short, goofy phrase. So I opened up the app on my dev build and it worked great with up to 8000 characters. I switched over to the staging build and was able to reproduce the error immediately.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was just the test_area, but I was wrong. Even static fields which displayed narrative cut off text. After some testing, the text was always cut off to 255 characters. I watched the SQL logs and confirmed that all 8000 characters would come back from the SQL queries. I looked in the database and verified the data was still present. What was going on?</p>

<h4>Dear Rails: Oh, you</h4>

<p>I thought and eventually realized something: the default of a &ldquo;string&rdquo; in Rails is 255 characters. Rails was cutting off my text. Curse you, Rails, I trusted you with my heart!</p>

<h4>The Fix</h4>

<p>Alright. The fix. Unfortunately, the fix sucks. In my app, I had to get the whole model that contained a narrative. Doing only that, the narrative would be cut short. So then I had to get the narrative again, and this time cast that sucker to a &ldquo;text.&rdquo;</p>

<p><code>ruby &lt; 1337 Hax
@eval = Evaluation.find(:id =&gt; id)
@eval.narrative = Evaluation.select("id as id, CAST(narrative as text) as narrative").where(:id =&gt; id).first.narrative
</code></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a part of me that likes sensible, clean code. This code did not come from that part of me. If you really want, you can do a select and get all the columns of your model, and then case the field in question, but what if your columns change? I didn&rsquo;t want to be responsible for that, especially after I hand this code off to someone else in the coming weeks.</p>
