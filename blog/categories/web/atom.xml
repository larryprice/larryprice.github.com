    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on SEP Labs' <a href="//h2w.cc">Health2Wealth</a> app, I got my first taste of setting up a website to use secure connections. I&rsquo;ve been using the browser extension <a href="//www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> for quite some time now, so all of the web pages that I visit attempt to using <code>HTTPS</code>instead of the standard <code>HTTP</code>. When I inadvertently started testing our app with <code>HTTPS</code>, things got a little weird.</p>

<p>My machine was able to open most of a page, but it wouldn&rsquo;t load some of the graphics or javascript we had embedded in the page. I was the only one able to reproduce it, so we chalked it up to a wonky machine. Then I suddenly remembered that I was using HTTPS Everywhere. I found the area in FireFox that warns you about insecure connections and found that our page was only <em>partially</em> loading on my browser because some of the content was insecure. From there I enabled an option to reveal the insecure elements, which forced my page to load everything correctly. So now we needed to find what was insecure about our page. I trekked through the codebase and found that some of our graphs and links were hard-coded to use <code>HTTP</code>. My initial thought was just to force them to use <code>HTTPS</code>, which is <a href="//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013OctDec/0625.html">almost certainly the impending standard</a>. With a quick search, I found that there exists a <strong>real</strong> solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have a very normal web application, so I want to include <a href="//jquery.com">jQuery</a> embedded in my page. I initially copy-paste <code>&lt;script src='http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> right into my <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> node, which normally seems fine. Unfortunately, this is where issues arise. I&rsquo;m now forcing the user to make a connection which may or may not be secure to fetch data from an insecure page.</p>

<p>By removing the <code>http:</code> from the <code>http://</code>, the issue of deciding whether to fetch the file using <code>HTTP</code> or <code>HTTPS</code> is left to the web browser. So my script include becomes <code>&lt;script src='http://larry-price.com//code.jquery.com/jquery.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> This also works for links, images, and web fonts. In fact, every link included in this post uses the same principal, where I leave the protocol out of what becomes the <code>href</code> tag.</p>

    <updated>2014-02-12T21:30:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/02/12/custom-domain-with-github-pages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of today, I&rsquo;m the proud owner of <a href="//larry-price.com">larry-price.com</a>. On the recommendation from a friend, I used <a href="//domainmonster.com">domainmonster.com</a> for it&rsquo;s cost effectiveness and usable toolset. I wanted to link my Github Pages blog (this blog!) to my new site. In case I ever want to do this again, I&rsquo;ve provided myself (and you!) with a step-by-step guide below. Note that Github <a href="//help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">has a page that explains how to do this</a>, but there&rsquo;s some fluff and ordering issues that turned me off from using those instructions as any more than a reference.</p>

<h4>Step 0: Buy your domain</h4>

<p>All sites where you can purchase domains have the same domains available, but at different prices. From the sites I perused, <a href="//godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> had the best search for domain names, suggesting different variations on the searched domain name. I found that <a href="//domainmonster.com">domainmonster.com</a> had the ugliest UI but the best prices. <a href="//hover.com">Hover.com</a> looked really modern and had moderate prices. Shop around and spend money.</p>

<h4>Step 0.5: Exercise restraint</h4>

<p>At this point in the process, <strong>don&rsquo;t go to your site</strong>.</p>

<p>My guess is you already have. If you don&rsquo;t have the ability to go back in time, don&rsquo;t sweat it, just know that you probably won&rsquo;t be able to verify the fruits of your labor for a few hours.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Setting up an &lsquo;A Record&rsquo;</h4>

<p>Find the ip address where your site is currently hosted. For me (replace URL with your own):</p>

<p>``` bash
$ nslookup larryprice.github.io
Server:   127.0.1.1
Address:  127.0.1.1#53</p>

<p>Non-authoritative answer:
Name: larryprice.github.io
Address: 199.27.74.133
```</p>

<p>You should be able to &ldquo;manage&rdquo; your domain on your domain provider&rsquo;s website. In the &ldquo;management&rdquo; area, you should be able to find a section about &ldquo;DNS&rdquo;. Find something labeled &ldquo;A records.&rdquo; There will likely already be one or two entries here &ndash; one for the IP address of your new domain and one with the IP address of your domain with &ldquo;www.&rdquo; prepended.</p>

<p>Modify the entry (or entries) with the IP address found using <code>nslookup</code> (&ldquo;199.27.74.133&rdquo; from the example above). Save your site settings.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Mucking with the &ldquo;www&rdquo; instance</h4>

<p>While we&rsquo;re modifying these settings, we might as well move the &lsquo;www&rsquo; case out of the &ldquo;A records&rdquo;. Go ahead and delete it.</p>

<p>Look for something named &ldquo;CNAME records&rdquo;, or figure out how to add records in general. We&rsquo;re going to add a CNAME record where the &ldquo;Alias&rdquo; is &ldquo;www&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Address&rdquo; is your site&rsquo;s name. In my case, my &ldquo;Alias&rdquo; field is &ldquo;www&rdquo; and my &ldquo;Address&rdquo; field is &ldquo;larry-price.com&rdquo;. Add the record and cross your fingers for success.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Telling Github Pages what to do</h4>

<p>Alhtough Github Pages is magical in its own right, it doesn&rsquo;t know what to do when receiving a request from the &ldquo;A record&rdquo; we created in Step 2 without further instruction.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Github Pages for a user page, we are going to make this change on the <code>master</code> branch. If this is a project page, do it on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<p>All we have to do is put our new domain into a file in the root folder called <code>CNAME</code>. Let&rsquo;s do it in one fell swoop of the command line.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ echo "larry-price.com" &gt; CNAME
</code></p>

<p>Push that to Github and wait 0 to 10 minutes for Github to refresh your page.</p>

<p>Note: If you&rsquo;re one of the few, the proud using the brilliant <a href="//octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to generate your blog, you want to make sure to add the <code>CNAME</code> file to the root of your <code>source/</code> directory. That way, when you call <code>deploy</code> your <code>CNAME</code> file will end up in the root of your <code>_deploy</code> directory.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Behold</h4>

<p>Check your Github repository&rsquo;s &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; section. In the &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo; section, you should now see something along the lines of &ldquo;Your site is published at <a href="http://larry-price.com">http://larry-price.com</a>&rdquo;. Go, young one, and visit your new site; and behold the glory you have brought to your family.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll note that this is the point where not obeying Step 0.5 will cause issues. Once your internets knows that your page hit a certain DNS, it takes a few hours to refresh. In my case it only took about 2 hours, but it may take between 12 and 48 hours to refresh. A workaround to see if everything is working is to pull out your smart phone and use your carrier&rsquo;s network to check your new site, since that area of the internets is probably still untainted. (All of this paragraph is a simplified thought process on how DNS works, considering that&rsquo;s the level I understand it.)</p>

<p>Now fly, my children, and spread yourself over the internet with dozens of silly domain names!</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/01/07/finishing-the-google-go-writing-web-applications-tutorial/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-07T22:45:03-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/01/07/finishing-the-google-go-writing-web-applications-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>A golang web app tutorial</h3>

<p>I did some work with <a href="http://golang.org/">Google Go</a> recently and had the chance to follow their great tutorial <em><a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/">Writing Web Applications</a></em>. The tutorial is pretty simple: use the Go http library to create a very simple wiki-style site. I like this tutorial a lot because there&rsquo;s not too much hand-holding, but they do eventually hand you the <a href="http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/final.go">final code listing</a>. Then the good people at Google give you the tall task of completing the following &lsquo;Other tasks&rsquo; without solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/.</li>
<li>Add a handler to make the web root redirect to /view/FrontPage.</li>
<li>Spruce up the page templates by making them valid HTML and adding some CSS rules.</li>
<li>Implement inter-page linking by converting instances of [PageName] to
&lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://larry-price.com/view/PageName">http://larry-price.com/view/PageName</a>&rdquo;>PageName&lt;/a>. (hint: you could use regexp.ReplaceAllFunc to do this)</li>
</ul>


<p>This is what I&rsquo;d like to go over. I scoured the web and didn&rsquo;t have much luck finding solutions to these issues. That would be okay if they were all trivial, but the final step is not straightforward. I&rsquo;m going to assume you&rsquo;ve already gone over the tutorial. You can see <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/">my repository on Github</a>, and I have included links to the appropriate commits in the code sections of this blog post.</p>

<h4>Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/</h4>

<p>The tutorial originally has the developer store all pages in the project directory. Every time a user made a new wiki page, a new file would creep into the project directory. All HTML templates were also stored in the project directory.</p>

<p>Moving templates is quite trivial. In the global scope:</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/9994d11b5275bc5faee911e5db2c994bc91052e2
-var templates = template.Must(template.ParseFiles("edit.html", "view.html"))
+var templates = template.Must(template.ParseFiles("tmpl/edit.html", "tmpl/view.html"))
</code></p>

<p>I found moving the page data to <code>data/</code> was a little trickier, especially if the directory didn&rsquo;t already exist. You may not have the same issue, but I remedied this by creating the directory if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. My <code>save</code> function differences:</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/e86a707d37b802b2d59b8ef261b3fdcab46d5870
func (p *Page) save() error {
-    filename := p.Title + ".txt"
-    return ioutil.WriteFile(filename, p.Body, 0600)
+  os.Mkdir("data", 0777)
+  filename := "data/" + p.Title + ".txt"
+  return ioutil.WriteFile(filename, p.Body, 0600)
}
</code></p>

<h4>Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/</h4>

<p>All we&rsquo;re going to do is create a simple handler called <code>rootHandler</code> that redirects to a new page called <code>FrontPage</code>. We then add it in the <code>main</code> function. The tutorial had us wrap out handlers in a function call to take some special actions, but that wrapper would mess up our handler in its current form. So I just <code>Redirect</code> to the <code>view</code> handler, which will then decide whether to view or create the FrontPage.</p>

<p>``` diff wiki.go <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/e41fccc2d244a3b0d62d600d94897a076c87d53d">https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/e41fccc2d244a3b0d62d600d94897a076c87d53d</a>
+ func rootHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
+   http.Redirect(w, r, &ldquo;/view/FrontPage&rdquo;, http.StatusFound)
+ }</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>func main() {
+  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/&rdquo;, rootHandler)
  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/view/&rdquo;, makeHandler(viewHandler))
  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/edit/&rdquo;, makeHandler(editHandler))
  http.HandleFunc(&ldquo;/save/&rdquo;, makeHandler(saveHandler))
```</p>

<h4>Spruce up the page templates by making them valid HTML and adding some CSS rules.</h4>

<p>I took my old <code>.html</code> files and put them through <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">a validator</a>. Making them valid only involved adding <code>DOCTYPE</code>, <code>html</code>, and <code>head</code> tags. The <code>head</code> tag needed <code>meta</code>, and <code>title</code> tags and we were valid. I&rsquo;ve shown <code>view.html</code> below.</p>

<p>``` diff view.html <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/771b4ecc8a550ee438720dc5c3d3f47954a1e4ff">https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/771b4ecc8a550ee438720dc5c3d3f47954a1e4ff</a>
+&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
+<html>
+<head>
+<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

 <h1></h1></p>

<p> <p>[<a href="http://larry-price.com/edit/">edit</a>]</p></p>

<p> <div></div>
+</html>
```</p>

<h4>Implement inter-page linking by converting instances of [PageName]</h4>

<p>Converting [PageName] to a hyperlink was a bit more complicated than expected. I originally just tried to run the string through <code>ReplaceAllFunc</code> and replace all instance of [PageName] with an equivalent hyperlink. This does not work because we use Go&rsquo;s <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> method to render our template. <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> escapes any HTML that we give it to prevent us from displaying unwanted HTML. Getting around this was the fun part, because I want the benefit of escaped HTML while still having the ability to substitute my own HTML.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> will not escape variables of the type <code>template.HTML</code>. So I added another variable onto the <code>Page</code> struct called <code>DisplayBody</code>.</p>

<p>``` diff wiki.go <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288">https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288</a>
type Page struct {</p>

<pre><code> Title string
 Body  []byte
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li> DisplayBody template.HTML
}
```</li>
</ul>


<p>Next, I create a regular expression to find instances of [PageName] and I put the defintion above the <code>main</code> method.</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288
+var linkRegexp = regexp.MustCompile("\\[([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\\]")
</code></p>

<p>In my <code>viewHandler</code>, I escape <code>Body</code> and then set <code>DisplayBody</code> to that escaped string with the links substituted.</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288
+  escapedBody := []byte(template.HTMLEscapeString(string(p.Body)))
+
+  p.DisplayBody = template.HTML(linkRegexp.ReplaceAllFunc(escapedBody, func(str []byte) []byte {
+      matched := linkRegexp.FindStringSubmatch(string(str))
+      out := []byte("&lt;a href=\"/view/"+matched[1]+"\"&gt;"+matched[1]+"&lt;/a&gt;")
+      return out
+    }))
  renderTemplate(w, "view", p)
}
</code></p>

<p>To finish up, I modify the <code>view.html</code> to show <code>DisplayBody</code>. I don&rsquo;t use <code>printf</code>, because that would turn <code>DisplayBody</code> back into a <code>string</code> and <code>ExecuteTemplate</code> would escape it.</p>

<p><code>diff wiki.go https://github.com/larryprice/gowiki/commit/38c48717420de78f15dc48152ce16d1bdb417288
-&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
+&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></p>

<p>And that completes the extra exercises for Google&rsquo;s <em>Writing Web Applications</em> tutorial. Hopefully one day this helps someone who gets stuck.</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/08/31/using-foreman-to-create-an-upstart-service/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-31T17:05:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/08/31/using-foreman-to-create-an-upstart-service</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished my first attempt at deploying a web app to run automatically in the background on a friend&rsquo;s server. Pretty easy, really. The first thing I did was install <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a>. Assuming you have ruby and rubygems installed:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo gem install foreman
</code></p>

<p>Next I needed to give foreman the commands to start my app. I created a file in the root of my project directory called &lsquo;Procfile&rsquo; and gave it the steps I would run to start my app manually. For the sake of simplicity, let&rsquo;s say I run my app pretty barebones:</p>

<p><code>bash Procfile
web: bundle exec rackup
</code></p>

<p>Now when I run <code>foreman start</code>, foreman will use <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> to execute rackup with the correct gems in my Gemfile. Now exporting upstart config files is pretty easy.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo foreman export upstart --app=MyApp --user=root /etc/init
</code></p>

<p>That command creates the .conf files needed for upstart to control the service called &lsquo;MyApp&rsquo; as the user &lsquo;root.&rsquo; It puts all the .conf files in <code>/etc/init</code> (which is where Ubuntu puts such things) and will create a default log directory in <code>/var/log/MyApp</code>. Now I can control my service by running <code>service MyApp start</code>, <code>service MyApp stop</code>, <code>service MyApp restart</code>, and <code>service MyApp status</code>. Hooray for me.</p>

<p>But I need to run my app in two ways: in dev mode on a local port with my dev database, and I need to run it in production mode using port 80 and the production database. I&rsquo;ve also heard that using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEBrick">webrick</a> (the default server installed with rackup) is great for develpment, but I should be using something else for my production server. So I made some config files for foreman:</p>

<p><code>bash development.env
RACK_ENV=development
PORT=9292
SERVER=rackup
</code></p>

<p><code>bash production.env
RACK_ENV=production
PORT=80
SERVER=unicorn
</code></p>

<p>And I change my Procfile to:</p>

<p><code>bash Procfile
web: bundle exec $SERVER -p $PORT -E $RACK_ENV
</code></p>

<p>Ridiculously configured. Now when I run <code>foreman start</code>, it will error out. I need to specify my environment file:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ foreman start -e production.env
</code></p>

<p>Now foreman will use Bundler to startup the server specified in <code>$SERVER</code>, run the app on port <code>$PORT</code> (-p), and will pass through the environment listed as <code>$RACK_ENV</code> to my application (-E), allowing my app to do whatever configuration it does given the current environment. Power to the people.</p>

<p><a href="http://michaelvanrooijen.com/articles/2011/06/08-managing-and-monitoring-your-ruby-application-with-foreman-and-upstart/">I found that this guy</a> does a lot more complicated stuff with Foreman, if you need more.</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/08/26/on-the-futility-of-man-and-trying-to-divide-a-sinatra-app-into-separate-controllers/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-26T22:35:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/08/26/on-the-futility-of-man-and-trying-to-divide-a-sinatra-app-into-separate-controllers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh, <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. You&rsquo;re oh-so-very dear to me. You made it so easy for me to write my <a href="http://capitalpunishment.herokuapp.com">first</a> <a href="http://pokephile.herokuapp.com">web</a> apps. All I had to do was write a couple routes and throw together a few HTML-like files and I had a web app. I used pattern matching to reduce the web-facing code for <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/CapitalPunishment">Capital Punishment</a> from ~500 lines of code to &lt;100 lines of code. You are perfect for writing small-time web applications.</p>

<p>But what about large web applications? What about a web app that has normal users and admin users, makes lots of database reads and writes (my previous apps only did reads from a user-facing perspective), and has to be able to show the history of everything, forever, to the authorized users who request it?</p>

<p>You see, Sinatra is kind of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC framework</a>, but not exactly. In Sinatra, you have Views (your HTML inter-mixed with Ruby code in your desired DSL) and you have Controllers (each of your routes). When a database is involved, you can use something like <a href="https://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra-activerecord">ActiveRecord</a> or <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html">Mongoid</a> or <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> and you have yourself Models.</p>

<p>So every route is kind of a Controller. Every. Route. In Capital Punishment, there were once 8 routes (there are now 7). In the project I&rsquo;ve been working on recently, there are currently 56 routes. 56 routes in the language described above means I kind of have 56 controllers.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been pretty overwhelming, especially since the traditional way of creating routes in Sinatra is to shove them all in the same file. There are a few ways I could think of to address this. The way we chose six months ago (for better or worse) was found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5877000/what-is-a-controller-in-sinatra">on StackOverflow</a>, and involves creating a bunch of different files where you shove all related routes. So you get this situation:</p>

<p>``` ruby app.rb
class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
end</p>

<p>require_relative &lsquo;controllers/helpers&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dir.glob(&ldquo;#{File.dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>)}/controllers/*.rb&rdquo;).each do |file|
  require file.chomp(File.extname(file))
end</p>

<p>class App
  get &lsquo;/&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>erb :home
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>``` ruby controllers/reports_controller.rb
class App
  get &lsquo;/reports/user_bills&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>erb :user_bills_report
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  &hellip;
end
```</p>

<p>And so on and so forth. This works fine for a while, but we&rsquo;ve ended up with 13 &ldquo;controller&rdquo; files, many of which are not trivial. This also makes the App class quite large since its controllers handle most of the logic for the app. This also doesn&rsquo;t enforce any kind of URL-naming logic, so if a developer is working hard (s)he may create both <code>/reports/user_bills</code> and <code>user_info_reports</code> without realizing the inconsistency (s)he just injected into the system.</p>

<p>In hindsight, this method is not perfect. I think that the Rails method of individual controllers is significantly better for large apps. Some people have been using other methods for trying to make Sinatra more MVC, such as <a href="https://github.com/jorrizza/sinatra-mvc">sinatra-mvc</a>. To be frank, sinatra-mvc pretty much does the same thing we&rsquo;ve done, but with more structure.</p>

<p>I think what I&rsquo;ve learned is that you should use a tool for its intended purpose. Sinatra was written to quickly create web apps in Ruby with minimal effort. Once you have more than 10-15 routes, you should reconsider whether your app can still be called &ldquo;minimal effort.&rdquo; Sinatra may fly you to the moon, but you&rsquo;re unlikely to see what spring is like on Jupiter or Mars.</p>
