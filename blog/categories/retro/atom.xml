    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="//agileindy.org/conference/">The AgileIndy Conference 2014</a> has come and gone. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect, since it was my first conference, but I came out of it feeling rather positive.</p>

<p>A short list of my favorite things from this year&rsquo;s AgileIndy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interesting speakers</li>
<li>Good food</li>
<li>Uncomfortable chairs</li>
<li><a href="//twitter.com/search?q=%23agileindy14&amp;src=hash">#agileindy14</a></li>
<li>Free booze</li>
<li>Lots of coffee</li>
<li>Champion dogs</li>
</ul>


<p>Good times. Personally, I found the first half of the day to be superior to the afternoon. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was the speakers or if I&rsquo;m just a morning person, but I&rsquo;m much more interested in discussing what the morning speakers had to say.</p>

<h3>The Dude</h3>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve got hard problems to solve, we don&rsquo;t need aphorisms, we don&rsquo;t need truisms.
&ndash; David Hussman</p></blockquote>

<p>The event started out with the self-proclaimed &ldquo;Dude,&rdquo; <a href="//devjam.com/">David Hussman of DevJam</a>. I&rsquo;ve previously had some training involving Mr Hussman at <a href="//sep.com">SEP</a>, during which we had trouble explaining our relationship with Agile: gargantuan project, lots of devs, massive codebase, hour-long builds, and an immature implementation of the so-called Scalable Agile Framework. I thought I knew what to expect during this talk, but I was delightfully mistaken. Everything Hussman said during his keynote fit with the conversations I&rsquo;ve been having with my current teammates.</p>

<p>Hussman talked about &ldquo;process mass,&rdquo; or the weight that you carry as you gain more and more process on a project. &ldquo;Measure your success by evidence, not by adherence&rdquo; to the process. What good is completing a story if you don&rsquo;t have anything to show for it, or if you don&rsquo;t have the quality to back it up? Hussman discussed scrum, and the ridiculous concept of &ldquo;scrum of scrums,&rdquo; and potentially even a &ldquo;scrum of scrum of scrums.&rdquo; In his own words, &ldquo;At some point you have to have something other than a naming convention.&rdquo; Getting stuff done and feeling satisfied with your work is much more important than being able to audit the lifetime of a story, or what day of the week your team gets the most done, or how many meetings your ScrumMaster goes to.</p>

<p>Speaking of ScrumMasters (and Product Owners and Tech Leads for that matter), the Dude wants us to think critically about these roles. Why are Scrum Masters and Tech Leads in meetings all day? A Tech Lead mosies into standup in the morning just to say, &ldquo;Yesterday I was in meetings all day, today I&rsquo;m in meetings all day, no blockers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Somehow [we&rsquo;ve] bonded the process to the people,&rdquo; using process to hold team members hostage. We&rsquo;ve found ourselves turning Agile into a bloated mess, and we&rsquo;re in need of people to relieve the pressure.</p>

<h3>Estimation</h3>

<p>During the first break-out session, <a href="//vance.com/">Steve Vance</a> talked about estimation, one of my favorite topics to complain about.</p>

<p>We started out by defining terms. Unfortunately, we use the word &ldquo;estimation&rdquo; to mean almost anything, from the very precise to the very vague. We &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; in T-shirt sizes, story points, days, and hours. We all mean something different when we make an estimation; it all boils down to an opinion. &ldquo;The work is going to take what it takes,&rdquo; and everyone has an opinion on how long that is.</p>

<p>I mentioned hours in the above paragraph as a unit of estimation. This is a particular pet peeve of mine: I absolutely despise estimating in hours. What do we even mean when we estimate in hours? Vance says, &ldquo;When I say hours as in this is going to take 3 hours, that does not mean 3 clock hours.&rdquo; So what <em>does</em> an hour mean? My current team uses a tool called TFS, which actually forces you to answer this question. So we &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; that Danny Developer will be able to accomplish 5 hours of work every day. We just turned Danny&rsquo;s day into hours on a clock. Now we &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; that a task will take &ldquo;about a day,&rdquo; which translates into 8 hours. Note that <code>1 task day != 1 Danny Day</code>. We&rsquo;re estimating tasks in these very precise units (real-life hours), and poor Danny will probably just work a 10-hour day to finish the task in &ldquo;1 day,&rdquo; which is what the team estimated the task would take.</p>

<p>T-shirt sizing or story points should be able to alleviate these problems, but we have to be vigilant not to concretely define these terms. Estimates should always be relative to yesterday&rsquo;s weather and not based on real time frames. Once you&rsquo;ve defined a 5-point story as taking exactly 5 days, you&rsquo;ve destroyed the whole system and you might as well start estimating in hours again.</p>

<h3>Anti-fragility</h3>

<p><a href="//salhir.wordpress.com">Si Alhir</a> discussed the principles of &ldquo;anti-fragility&rdquo; during the pre-lunch session. Anti-fragility is a post-Agile concept. That&rsquo;s right: <em>post-Agile</em>. I know you were just getting used to Agile, but it seems that we&rsquo;ve created a monster that&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to control. Teams find themselves saying &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not Agile, we&rsquo;re Agile&rdquo; when describing the pitfalls of other teams.</p>

<p>So what is anti-fragility? It&rsquo;s easier to define in relative terms. Traditional teams are hurt by change and actively resist change; Agile teams embrace change and are able to inspect and adapt to it; Anti-Fragile teams embrace disorder and are able to adapt and evolve to chaos. &ldquo;Fragile teams want tranquility,&rdquo; while anti-fragile teams &ldquo;gain from stress.&rdquo; Anti-fragility involves shifting from focusing on avoiding risk to focusing on overcoming risk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you removed?&rdquo; Si asks, reiterating Hussman from earlier in the day. &ldquo;More rules, more process causes more fragility.&rdquo; As our Agile teams add process, this becomes more evident. &ldquo;Dependency,&rdquo; &ldquo;the line between dev and test&rdquo;, and &ldquo;centralized power&rdquo; all cause fragility. Sprint cycles every 1-2 weeks cause a constant stress, which &ldquo;will kill you, numb you.&rdquo; Anti-fragile teams prefer &ldquo;acute stress with recovery time&rdquo; caused by overcoming risk as it materializes. The so-called ScrumMaster of an Agile team is protecting the team from risk, contributing to the overall fragility of the team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most fragile thing in the Agile world is teams,&rdquo; Si insists. &ldquo;Consistent, co-located teams.&rdquo; Teams should be able to be disbanded and created at-will or &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; as the need arises. Teams are created to attack &ldquo;focal points,&rdquo; or areas that need attention right away. This is an especially hard pill to swallow, since many of us like the familial feeling that comes with long-term teams. Not to mention the nightmares of billing if you&rsquo;re a consulting company.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There were a few other speakers at the conference, but none hit quite as close to home as the three I&rsquo;ve discussed. Overall a very interesting conference and a very fun experience. I&rsquo;m excited to think about these ideas and I&rsquo;d like to attempt to use some of them to make my teams more efficient and maybe even a little happier. It looks like the general flow is to move away from massive amounts of process, working more like Lean Startup or Anti-fragile teams.</p>

<p>A decade from now, we&rsquo;ll be living in a post-anti-fragile world wondering what on earth we were thinking in this world of rules, definitions, estimations, and process.</p>

    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/08/26/on-the-futility-of-man-and-trying-to-divide-a-sinatra-app-into-separate-controllers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh, <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. You&rsquo;re oh-so-very dear to me. You made it so easy for me to write my <a href="http://capitalpunishment.herokuapp.com">first</a> <a href="http://pokephile.herokuapp.com">web</a> apps. All I had to do was write a couple routes and throw together a few HTML-like files and I had a web app. I used pattern matching to reduce the web-facing code for <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/CapitalPunishment">Capital Punishment</a> from ~500 lines of code to &lt;100 lines of code. You are perfect for writing small-time web applications.</p>

<p>But what about large web applications? What about a web app that has normal users and admin users, makes lots of database reads and writes (my previous apps only did reads from a user-facing perspective), and has to be able to show the history of everything, forever, to the authorized users who request it?</p>

<p>You see, Sinatra is kind of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC framework</a>, but not exactly. In Sinatra, you have Views (your HTML inter-mixed with Ruby code in your desired DSL) and you have Controllers (each of your routes). When a database is involved, you can use something like <a href="https://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra-activerecord">ActiveRecord</a> or <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html">Mongoid</a> or <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> and you have yourself Models.</p>

<p>So every route is kind of a Controller. Every. Route. In Capital Punishment, there were once 8 routes (there are now 7). In the project I&rsquo;ve been working on recently, there are currently 56 routes. 56 routes in the language described above means I kind of have 56 controllers.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been pretty overwhelming, especially since the traditional way of creating routes in Sinatra is to shove them all in the same file. There are a few ways I could think of to address this. The way we chose six months ago (for better or worse) was found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5877000/what-is-a-controller-in-sinatra">on StackOverflow</a>, and involves creating a bunch of different files where you shove all related routes. So you get this situation:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby app.rb">class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
end

require_relative 'controllers/helpers'

Dir.glob("#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/controllers/*.rb").each do |file|
  require file.chomp(File.extname(file))
end

class App
  get '/' do
    erb :home
  end
end
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="ruby controllers/reports_controller.rb">class App
  get '/reports/user_bills' do
    erb :user_bills_report
  end
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>And so on and so forth. This works fine for a while, but we&rsquo;ve ended up with 13 &ldquo;controller&rdquo; files, many of which are not trivial. This also makes the App class quite large since its controllers handle most of the logic for the app. This also doesn&rsquo;t enforce any kind of URL-naming logic, so if a developer is working hard (s)he may create both <code>/reports/user_bills</code> and <code>user_info_reports</code> without realizing the inconsistency (s)he just injected into the system.</p>

<p>In hindsight, this method is not perfect. I think that the Rails method of individual controllers is significantly better for large apps. Some people have been using other methods for trying to make Sinatra more MVC, such as <a href="https://github.com/jorrizza/sinatra-mvc">sinatra-mvc</a>. To be frank, sinatra-mvc pretty much does the same thing we&rsquo;ve done, but with more structure.</p>

<p>I think what I&rsquo;ve learned is that you should use a tool for its intended purpose. Sinatra was written to quickly create web apps in Ruby with minimal effort. Once you have more than 10-15 routes, you should reconsider whether your app can still be called &ldquo;minimal effort.&rdquo; Sinatra may fly you to the moon, but you&rsquo;re unlikely to see what spring is like on Jupiter or Mars.</p>

    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/08/07/the-trouble-with-time-zones-aka-learn-from-your-mistakes-pt-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>As a user, my data&rsquo;s LastModifiedDate should not be updated when I Export it, and it should be in UTC.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the gist of the story I was tasked with a few weeks ago. Seemed easy enough: just set the &ldquo;LastModifiedDate&rdquo; field of each XML node to the LastModifiedDate pulled from the database converted to UTC. I can do the development and write up some Cucumber tests in an hour, two hours tops. Find a few small caveats along the way, get it out of development and through code review by the next morning. Push it to the mainline and watch the build go green. All done, dust off my hands and move on to something else.</p>

<p>When has anything ever been that simple? Certainly not in the fantastical world of software development! About ten minutes after the build server confirmed a successful build of my code on the tip of our main branch, a face popped up over the cube wall. &ldquo;Hey, why&rsquo;d you break the build?&rdquo; My teammate was having trouble running my LastModifiedDate tests. All of his time comparisons were off by an hour. My computer (and the build server) were in one time zone; his was in another. I immediately realized the exact lines of the code that weren&rsquo;t dealing with time zones. We agreed to let the code remain on the build server instead of backing it out since the build server was green, and I created/tested/pushed a couple of patches to fix the problem. Green build on the build server. Green build amongst all my time-disabled peers. The next morning I had a panic attack in the shower thinking about how some of my test data could be affected by the switch to UTC. I rushed into work early and put in another patch, this one slightly changing the format of some of my test data. After doing this, I realized that what I had done was completely unnecessary and decided I should probably get my blood pressure checked.</p>

<p>Then: silence. I was satisfied I&rsquo;d seen the end of my time zone issues which I&rsquo;d spent nearly as much time patching as I had developing the initial solution. Two weeks pass. Monday morning there&rsquo;s an email from another country in my inbox, &ldquo;This test was written that only works in American time zones! Who is fixing this?&rdquo; After quite a few emails and chats I found that their main branch had merged in a version of our main branch between my original solution and my patch. The developer agreed to be patient until his team could start using the newer version of our branch. Four hours later I get another email from developers on another continent. I sent them the patches I made previously compressed into one to keep them working.</p>

<p>Was this a small mistake? On a project with a small, local team the answer is definitely yes. This project in particular involves a large number of developers who don&rsquo;t all test in the same time zone and who work on a number of different branches that feed into each other in weekly chunks. Despite that, I think this error could have gone greatly unnoticed had I simply backed out the original changes and pushed the patches and original solution together. My confidence (hubris?) really bit me on this one. Initially only a single developer seemed to be affected by my oversight; fate selected a build between my original solution and my patches to push to the other branches to make sure more people noticed my mistake.</p>

<p><strong>In hindsight</strong>, The Right Thing to Do was to assume fault and back out immediately. One developer having build issues is still one more than should have been affected. Here&rsquo;s hoping this bit o&#8217; hindsight today leads to better foresight tomorrow.</p>
