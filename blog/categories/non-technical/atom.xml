    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="//agileindy.org/conference/">The AgileIndy Conference 2014</a> has come and gone. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect, since it was my first conference, but I came out of it feeling rather positive.</p>

<p>A short list of my favorite things from this year&rsquo;s AgileIndy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interesting speakers</li>
<li>Good food</li>
<li>Uncomfortable chairs</li>
<li><a href="//twitter.com/search?q=%23agileindy14&amp;src=hash">#agileindy14</a></li>
<li>Free booze</li>
<li>Lots of coffee</li>
<li>Champion dogs</li>
</ul>


<p>Good times. Personally, I found the first half of the day to be superior to the afternoon. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was the speakers or if I&rsquo;m just a morning person, but I&rsquo;m much more interested in discussing what the morning speakers had to say.</p>

<h3>The Dude</h3>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve got hard problems to solve, we don&rsquo;t need aphorisms, we don&rsquo;t need truisms.
&mdash; David Hussman</p></blockquote>

<p>The event started out with the self-proclaimed &ldquo;Dude,&rdquo; <a href="//devjam.com/">David Hussman of DevJam</a>. I&rsquo;ve previously had some training involving Mr Hussman at <a href="//sep.com">SEP</a>, during which we had trouble explaining our relationship with Agile: gargantuan project, lots of devs, massive codebase, hour-long builds, and an immature implementation of the so-called Scalable Agile Framework. I thought I knew what to expect during this talk, but I was delightfully mistaken. Everything Hussman said during his keynote fit with the conversations I&rsquo;ve been having with my current teammates.</p>

<p>Hussman talked about &ldquo;process mass,&rdquo; or the weight that you carry as you gain more and more process on a project. &ldquo;Measure your success by evidence, not by adherence&rdquo; to the process. What good is completing a story if you don&rsquo;t have anything to show for it, or if you don&rsquo;t have the quality to back it up? Hussman discussed scrum, and the ridiculous concept of &ldquo;scrum of scrums,&rdquo; and potentially even a &ldquo;scrum of scrum of scrums.&rdquo; In his own words, &ldquo;At some point you have to have something other than a naming convention.&rdquo; Getting stuff done and feeling satisfied with your work is much more important than being able to audit the lifetime of a story, or what day of the week your team gets the most done, or how many meetings your ScrumMaster goes to.</p>

<p>Speaking of ScrumMasters (and Product Owners and Tech Leads for that matter), the Dude wants us to think critically about these roles. Why are Scrum Masters and Tech Leads in meetings all day? A Tech Lead mosies into standup in the morning just to say, &ldquo;Yesterday I was in meetings all day, today I&rsquo;m in meetings all day, no blockers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Somehow [we&rsquo;ve] bonded the process to the people,&rdquo; using process to hold team members hostage. We&rsquo;ve found ourselves turning Agile into a bloated mess, and we&rsquo;re in need of people to relieve the pressure.</p>

<h3>Estimation</h3>

<p>During the first break-out session, <a href="//vance.com/">Steve Vance</a> talked about estimation, one of my favorite topics to complain about.</p>

<p>We started out by defining terms. Unfortunately, we use the word &ldquo;estimation&rdquo; to mean almost anything, from the very precise to the very vague. We &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; in T-shirt sizes, story points, days, and hours. We all mean something different when we make an estimation; it all boils down to an opinion. &ldquo;The work is going to take what it takes,&rdquo; and everyone has an opinion on how long that is.</p>

<p>I mentioned hours in the above paragraph as a unit of estimation. This is a particular pet peeve of mine: I absolutely despise estimating in hours. What do we even mean when we estimate in hours? Vance says, &ldquo;When I say hours as in this is going to take 3 hours, that does not mean 3 clock hours.&rdquo; So what <em>does</em> an hour mean? My current team uses a tool called TFS, which actually forces you to answer this question. So we &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; that Danny Developer will be able to accomplish 5 hours of work every day. We just turned Danny&rsquo;s day into hours on a clock. Now we &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; that a task will take &ldquo;about a day,&rdquo; which translates into 8 hours. Note that <code>1 task day != 1 Danny Day</code>. We&rsquo;re estimating tasks in these very precise units (real-life hours), and poor Danny will probably just work a 10-hour day to finish the task in &ldquo;1 day,&rdquo; which is what the team estimated the task would take.</p>

<p>T-shirt sizing or story points should be able to alleviate these problems, but we have to be vigilant not to concretely define these terms. Estimates should always be relative to yesterday&rsquo;s weather and not based on real time frames. Once you&rsquo;ve defined a 5-point story as taking exactly 5 days, you&rsquo;ve destroyed the whole system and you might as well start estimating in hours again.</p>

<h3>Anti-fragility</h3>

<p><a href="//salhir.wordpress.com">Si Alhir</a> discussed the principles of &ldquo;anti-fragility&rdquo; during the pre-lunch session. Anti-fragility is a post-Agile concept. That&rsquo;s right: <em>post-Agile</em>. I know you were just getting used to Agile, but it seems that we&rsquo;ve created a monster that&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to control. Teams find themselves saying &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not Agile, we&rsquo;re Agile&rdquo; when describing the pitfalls of other teams.</p>

<p>So what is anti-fragility? It&rsquo;s easier to define in relative terms. Traditional teams are hurt by change and actively resist change; Agile teams embrace change and are able to inspect and adapt to it; Anti-Fragile teams embrace disorder and are able to adapt and evolve to chaos. &ldquo;Fragile teams want tranquility,&rdquo; while anti-fragile teams &ldquo;gain from stress.&rdquo; Anti-fragility involves shifting from focusing on avoiding risk to focusing on overcoming risk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you removed?&rdquo; Si asks, reiterating Hussman from earlier in the day. &ldquo;More rules, more process causes more fragility.&rdquo; As our Agile teams add process, this becomes more evident. &ldquo;Dependency,&rdquo; &ldquo;the line between dev and test&rdquo;, and &ldquo;centralized power&rdquo; all cause fragility. Sprint cycles every 1-2 weeks cause a constant stress, which &ldquo;will kill you, numb you.&rdquo; Anti-fragile teams prefer &ldquo;acute stress with recovery time&rdquo; caused by overcoming risk as it materializes. The so-called ScrumMaster of an Agile team is protecting the team from risk, contributing to the overall fragility of the team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most fragile thing in the Agile world is teams,&rdquo; Si insists. &ldquo;Consistent, co-located teams.&rdquo; Teams should be able to be disbanded and created at-will or &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; as the need arises. Teams are created to attack &ldquo;focal points,&rdquo; or areas that need attention right away. This is an especially hard pill to swallow, since many of us like the familial feeling that comes with long-term teams. Not to mention the nightmares of billing if you&rsquo;re a consulting company.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There were a few other speakers at the conference, but none hit quite as close to home as the three I&rsquo;ve discussed. Overall a very interesting conference and a very fun experience. I&rsquo;m excited to think about these ideas and I&rsquo;d like to attempt to use some of them to make my teams more efficient and maybe even a little happier. It looks like the general flow is to move away from massive amounts of process, working more like Lean Startup or Anti-fragile teams.</p>

<p>A decade from now, we&rsquo;ll be living in a post-anti-fragile world wondering what on earth we were thinking in this world of rules, definitions, estimations, and process.</p>

    <updated>2014-02-22T17:47:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/02/22/let-me-be-a-billboard-for-duckduckgo-for-a-few-minutes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I would describe my job as 10% cleverness, 10% tenacity, 30% historical knowledge, and 50% searching the internet.</p>

<p>As you can see, a good search engine is extremely important to me. My job depends on it. Opening <a href="//www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium&rsquo;s</a> history, I can see that I have recently searched for microwaves, <a href="//rubygems.org/gems/activesupport">activesupport</a> compatibility in <a href="//www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby 2.1.0</a>, deleting branches in git, and glibc backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use <a href="//google.com">Lord Google</a> as my default search engine. Instead I use <a href="//duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>. From <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Duck_Go">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>DuckDuckGo is an Internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the &ldquo;filter bubble&rdquo; of personalized search results. DuckDuckGo distinguishes itself from other search engines by not profiling its users and by deliberately showing all users the same search results for a given search term. DuckDuckGo also emphasizes getting information from the best sources rather than the most sources&hellip;.</p></blockquote>

<p>The gist is that DuckDuckGo does not personalize your search results based on demographics or search history. It doesn&rsquo;t store your IP address and it doesn&rsquo;t log your information. You cannot &ldquo;log in&rdquo; to the DuckDuckGo website.</p>

<p>Getting down to brass tacks: How does it do search?</p>

<p>Searching on DuckDuckGo for queries such as &ldquo;Will Ferrell&rdquo; or &ldquo;Markdown&rdquo; will give you a blurb at the top of your search results from Wikipedia about that matching query. Searching programming topics (like &ldquo;ruby random array&rdquo; or &ldquo;asp.net create table&rdquo;) will give you a near-matching StackOverflow answer. Searching for a single word will usually give you the definition.</p>

<p>A query that seems mistyped will ask you if you want to correct it. Search speed is comparable to Google, I&rsquo;ve noticed no difference.</p>

<p>Looking at the result of your query, you get your search results middle-aligned. <strong>Middle. Aligned</strong> I know you probably don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a big deal, but go do a Google search right now. It&rsquo;s left-aligned. Same with <a href="//bing.com">Bing</a>. Do you see what&rsquo;s on the right half of your monitor? <strong>Nothing.</strong> When running a Google search with my 22" monitor (~19" of horizontal space), there are 13" of wasted space. About 9" on Bing.</p>

<p>So, you&rsquo;ve just done a search on DuckDuckGo. Now you can use the Up/Down arrows on your keyboard to navigate the search results. Pressing Enter takes you to the website. I vaguely remember that Google used to allow this, but it seems to have disappeared from the default search results.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t like being able to see the combined search results of 50+ search engines? !Bang syntax is the answer.</p>

<p>What is !bang syntax? Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re me and you&rsquo;re looking for over-the range microwaves. I type into my DuckDuckGo search <code>microwaves !a</code> and DuckDuckGo takes me straight to <a href="//amazon.com">Amazon</a>, showing me search results for all those sweet, sweet microwaves. <code>!g</code> takes you to Google, <code>!w</code> takes you to Wikipedia, <code>!gi</code> takes you to Google Images, <code>!yt</code> takes you to Youtube, <code>!lowes</code> takes you to the Lowe&rsquo;s search results, <code>!gog</code> takes you to Good Ol' Games, and <a href="//duckduckgo.com/bang.html">on and on and on and on and on</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a href="//duckduckgo.com/goodies">100s of other goodies</a> as well. Do math using an &ldquo;=&rdquo; sign, like &ldquo;=128*256&rdquo;. Find &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; examples by searching for &ldquo;hello world perl&rdquo; or &ldquo;hello world clojure&rdquo;. Do a Twitter hashtag search to find out what &ldquo;#yolo&rdquo; means. Currency conversions. Unit conversions. Convert between timezones.</p>

<p>Okay, enough shameless plugging for my favorite search engine. Give it a chance. Let those Google servers cool down for a few microseconds, they won&rsquo;t mind.</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/12/12/tell-your-users-when-you-fail/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-12T19:41:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/12/12/tell-your-users-when-you-fail</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your users put a lot of faith in you. They put up with your terrible design, your horrible taste in color scheme, and your ability to take up over 100% of their computer&rsquo;s memory. With that in mind, don&rsquo;t these poor people deserve a little bit of honesty?</p>

<p>I came across some code recently that irked me. This code asks for a handle to a database abstraction class and then runs a query on it. It looks kinda like this:</p>

<p>``` ruby settings.rb
def changeSettings(newSettings)
  db = dbFactory.get(&ldquo;settings.db&rdquo;)
  if !db.nil?</p>

<pre><code>db.execute(buildSaveQuery(newSettings))
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>How nice that <code>changeSettings</code> doesn&rsquo;t try to play with a <code>nil</code> database, right? But what about the user&rsquo;s data? It wasn&rsquo;t saved. And no one knows. <em>Not even you</em>. Now, maybe the user will happily continue what he&rsquo;s doing until he notices that his new settings aren&rsquo;t quite right. So he goes back to them again. Same result. Repeat ad infinitum.</p>

<p>How I would initially approach this is to add an <code>else</code> statement that launches a dialog giving some useful data to the user. Whatever you do, for the love of code, DO NOT tell the user that you had database problems. For most applications, the user will have no idea what that means. It might look something like this:</p>

<p>``` ruby settings.rb
def changeSettings(newSettings)
  db = dbFactory.get(&ldquo;settings.db&rdquo;)
  if !db.nil?</p>

<pre><code>db.execute(buildSaveQuery(newSettings))
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code>showDialog(title="Save Failed!",
           msg="I'm sorry, but your data could not be saved." +
               "Press 'Try Again' to give it another go." +
               "If the problem persists, restart the application" +
               " or contact system support.")
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>This is not a bad solution. But what about all the other places in the code I get the database from the factory? I&rsquo;d have to update those as well. It would be better to be able to code the factory to launch a similar error dialog whenever this happens. Even better, let me hand the factory a reference to an appropriate dialog whenever I call <code>dbFactory.get</code>.</p>

<p>Another much more frightening possibility is to skip the <code>nil</code> check. Can you guarantee that <code>dbFactory.get</code> will never be <code>nil</code>? In that case, this option is actually pretty good.</p>

<p>Even if that&rsquo;s not a guarantee you can make, it may still be a valid solution. <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/defenseP.html">Crash early before you do too much damage</a>. Now, if there&rsquo;s some kind of crash-handler or global exception-catcher in your application, then you can catch the impending crash and tell the user the application needs to be restarted&hellip; And the app probably needs to be restarted anyway! There&rsquo;s no need to keep running after you&rsquo;ve reached some horrible error state that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>Just do <em>something</em>! Your users (especially if that happens to include me) will appreciate your honesty, even if it&rsquo;s so brutal that they have to restart the application.</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/04/09/changing-plans/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-09T21:45:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/04/09/changing-plans</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your code is being sent to the dump.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t take it personally. Your code isn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em>. It&rsquo;s just <em>garbage</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe your code wasn&rsquo;t written the way they wanted you to write it. Or maybe they realized that they had already written this code three months ago. Or maybe the customer suddenly decided that they don&rsquo;t need their smartphone to emit fragrances based on the text message they just received.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;why&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t matter. Plans changed. Your unused code isn&rsquo;t aging well and it&rsquo;s starting to stink up the place, so just do us all a favor and get it outta here!</p>

<p>As developers, we <em>always</em> take this kind of thing personally. Our code is an extension of ourselves. When we feel good, we write code that&rsquo;s clean and concise. When we feel meh, our code is unimaginative and takes longer to write. When we feel bad, we litter the code with variables that don&rsquo;t do anything and then name them after our managers.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not personal, is it? Management doesn&rsquo;t sit in their mansion each evening, sipping a gin martini while adjusting their toupee, thinking about how worthless you are and how to properly punish you while continuing to pay you. Management has better things to think about, like ditching the toupee in favor of hair plugs or Rogaine or whatever hair fad is popular that day.</p>

<p>Plans change. You can lament your loss of three days of &ldquo;ingenious&rdquo; code that will never see the light of day, but management will be equally depressed about the hundreds (thousands?) of dollars lost paying you to work on something that&rsquo;s not production-worthy. You may feel cheated in the short-term, but hopefully you can get something positive out of this change of plan. Maybe your second attempt at the code will jive better with the base architecture, or maybe you&rsquo;ll be able to extract the functionality you need out of another component and limit code duplication, or maybe you&rsquo;ll be able to deliver a different feature that the customer can actually use.</p>

<p>Sure, there may be an occasional senior engineer who thinks that the program should be implemented his or her way, and will make you throw out anything you write that has any deviation from The Plan (which never quite made it out of their heads and into any documentation). Usually you can satiate that senior engineer by listening to them and nodding your head for a few minutes. There&rsquo;s a reason that engineer carries so much weight on the project, so they&rsquo;ll probably be making a valid point while you nod your head and they&rsquo;ll respect you for agreeing with them, even though you secretly wish you could just keep doing it the way you originally planned.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t cry over spilled milk. No one&rsquo;s actually questioning your coding competency when they change the plan. The odds are in your favor that the plan changed in the best interest of the project, and whatever code is being thrown out is likely a necessary casualty to benefit the system as a whole. Remember that most of the code you write is used, at least for a little while, so try not to dwell on the code that isn&rsquo;t.</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/04/01/whats-still-possible/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-01T22:35:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/04/01/whats-still-possible</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If every Miss America candidate had her way, there would be peace on Earth and all the hungry mouths would be fed. While Earthlings enjoy violence and controlling others too much to achieve world peace, I have a proposal to help feed those around the world who don&rsquo;t have enough to eat.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not an ad campaign. I&rsquo;m not going to send random people a nickle in the mail and then tell them that they could use that nickle to feed a starving child. I&rsquo;m certainly not going to change any of my eating habits. I happen to know a huge source of food that we underutilize. My plan is to kill two birds with one stone. Well, preferably something like 3 million birds with however many stones it takes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking, of course, about the terrible tyranny of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Goose">Canadian Goose</a>. A little history:</p>

<p>Our ancestors domesticated Canadian Geese in ancient times and used these waterfowl for various acts of labor, including pulling tugboats down the Mississippi, plowing the great Canadian rice paddies, and keeping our elderly company during their final days of life. The young goslings flapped gingerly in the meadows pollinating the wildflowers, apple trees, and various other meadow-related objects. Much to our delight, some of our beloved geese bretheren became sentient, and started selling us medical insurance while performing a spot-on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Gottfried">Gilbert Gottfried</a> impression.</p>

<p>False. I must apologize for fooling you in this way sweet, sweet reader, but everything you read in the last paragraph was neither true nor fact. In reality, Canadian Geese serve no purpose. Canadian Geese were created accidentally during the Manhatten Project while one of the lab techs from the local university was trying to combine nuclear fission and the bubonic plague to get back at his ex-girlfriend for cheating on him. He quickly became bored of this task when she stopped responding to his texts, and thusly tossed the waste from his experiments in the river. The rest, of course, is history.</p>

<p>Now here we are. There are well over <a href="http://www.ducks.org/hunting/waterfowl-id/canada-goose">3 million Canadian Geese nationwide</a>, which is decidedly more than anyone finds pleasant. These geese are no longer afraid of humans, so they tend not to run away from us. In fact, we have spoiled the birds so much that some geese will actually approach humans demanding a bite of stale bread. If no bread gift is offered, the foul fowl will emit a frightening hissing noise, raise its wings, and chase off the poor human. Any sidewalk near a pond quickly becomes covered in goose byproducts during the breeding season, which might as well be year-round. I, for one, think that the geese have gone too far. They ruin our picnics, our walks in the park, our egg-stealing competitions, and our feather-collecting scavenger hunts. It&rsquo;s time for the final showdown: Man versus Goose.</p>

<p>Time to tie in the beginning and the parts where I raved like a lunatic: We hunt the geese, and we feed them to people. &lsquo;Nuff said.</p>

<p>People already hunt geese, of course, but it&rsquo;s clearly not enough. Not to mention that these hunters currently just leave the gooseflesh in the woods where lower animals reap the rewards. I propose we extend goose season year-round, and provide free boxes to encourage hunters to package the gooseflesh and send it to the needy in other countries. We&rsquo;ll poison our waterways to take out as many geese as possible, and we will make a wondrous soup for whomever needs it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still possible to feed the hungry. But we need to <em>focus</em> in order to do it. Man versus Goose is not the solution. It&rsquo;s a demonstration of getting distracted from the original cause. The next time someone tries to get you riled up about feeding the hungry through some crazy scheme, remember that there&rsquo;s no better way than addressing the problem directly. It&rsquo;s still possible to do good in this world if you can avoid the crazy.</p>
