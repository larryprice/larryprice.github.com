    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Or rather, &ldquo;Not Using sqlite on Heroku.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="//heroku.com">Heroku</a> does not support <a href="//sqlite.org">sqlite</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to stop using sqlite in development, but it does mean we need to put in some workarounds to support our deployment environment. The rest of this article will use <a href="//ruby-lang.org">ruby</a> and <a href="//sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming you have a heroku app deployed and you have sqlite already working locally, this only takes a few steps. First we need to add a SQL database to our heroku app. From the project directory, we&rsquo;ll add the <a href="//addons.heroku.com/heroku-postgresql">heroku-postgresql</a> addon to our app.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
</code></p>

<p>The <code>dev</code> piece of this command tells heroku we want the small, free database. This database supports up to 10,000 rows and has a 99.5% uptime. Best of all: it&rsquo;s free. Other options have you pay $9/mo for 10,000,000 rows or $50+ for Unlimited usage. I recommend you start small.</p>

<p>Hopefully you got some success statements after adding heroku-postgresql. They should have included some new environment variables, which are links to your new Postgres database. Record these; we&rsquo;ll use them a little later.</p>

<p>Now we need to set up the back-end to be able to access a Postgres database when necessary. Hopefully you&rsquo;re using a decent abstraction library in your app that can access any SQL database. For ruby, I find <a href="//www.sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a> to be sufficient.</p>

<p>In our Gemfile, we&rsquo;ve probably already included the sqlite gem for use in our local environment. We can go ahead and move that into a <code>development</code> block, and we need to add the <code>pg</code> gem to either <code>production</code> or the global block.</p>

<p>``` ruby Gemfile
source &ldquo;<a href="https://rubygems.org">https://rubygems.org</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>ruby &lsquo;2.1.0&rsquo;</p>

<p>gem &lsquo;bundler&rsquo;
gem &lsquo;rake&rsquo;
gem &lsquo;sinatra&rsquo;
gem &lsquo;haml&rsquo;
gem &lsquo;sequel&rsquo;</p>

<p>group :production do
  gem &lsquo;pg&rsquo;
end</p>

<p>group :development do
  gem &lsquo;sqlite3&rsquo;
end
```</p>

<p>Heroku sets <code>ENV['RACK_ENV']</code> to &ldquo;production&rdquo; for us, which means that the pg gem should get picked up the next time we deploy. Now we need to tell our app which database to use in which situation.</p>

<p>One of the easiest places to make this decision is in Sinatra&rsquo;s <code>configure</code> block. I keep my local db in an environment variable called <code>LOCAL_DATABASE_URL</code>. This is where you use the environment variable heroku set for you when you set up your Postgres database; mine was called <code>HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_MAROON_URL</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby web.rb
class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
  configure :production do</p>

<pre><code>Sequel.connect ENV['HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_MAROON_URL']
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  configure :development do</p>

<pre><code>Sequel.connect ENV['LOCAL_DATABASE_URL']
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>This works because the default environment is &ldquo;development.&rdquo; Test locally, and then we can deploy.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ git push heroku master
</code></p>

<p>And enjoy.</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/03/20/using-the-trello-api-in-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-20T19:37:36-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/03/20/using-the-trello-api-in-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, you want to gather data using the <a href="//trello.com">Trello</a> API so that you can <a href="//ollert.herokuapp.com">do something cool with it</a>? And you&rsquo;re using <a href="//ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>? Enter <a href="//github.com/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello">ruby-trello</a>. Install!</p>

<p><code>bash
$ gem install ruby-trello
</code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start off easy, and assume that we&rsquo;re writing a personal application where we only need to access data for one user at a time. We start by configuring ruby-trello. I&rsquo;m going to assume that you&rsquo;ve already generated a public key and received a member token and stored them in your environment.</p>

<p>``` ruby global_config_test.rb
require &lsquo;trello&rsquo;</p>

<p>Trello.configure do |config|
  # API key generated by visiting <a href="https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate">https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate</a>
  config.developer_public_key = ENV[&lsquo;PUBLIC_KEY&rsquo;]</p>

<p>  # Member token
  # larry-price.com/blog/2014/03/18/connecting-to-the-trello-api/
  config.member_token = ENV[&lsquo;MEMBER_TOKEN&rsquo;]
end
```</p>

<p>This connects me to a specific member as found through <code>ENV['MEMBER_TOKEN']</code>. I previously wrote <a href="/blog/2014/03/18/connecting-to-the-trello-api/">another post</a> about getting a member token from a user.</p>

<p>For demonstration, I&rsquo;ll find myself, grab my first board, and then display the name, names of lists, members who have worked on the project, and some numbers about each of the cards in the board. This is essentially my proof of concept for a <a href="/blog/2014/03/17/sep-startup-weekend-ollert/">super-cool web-app I wrote</a> called <a href="//ollert.herokuapp.com">Ollert</a>.</p>

<p>``` ruby global_config_test.rb
&hellip;</p>

<h1>find myself</h1>

<p>me = Trello::Member.find(&ldquo;_larryprice&rdquo;)</p>

<h1>find first board</h1>

<p>board = me.boards.first
puts board.name
puts &ldquo;Lists: #{board.lists.map {|x| x.name}.join(&lsquo;, &rsquo;)}&rdquo;
puts &ldquo;Members: #{board.members.map {|x| x.full_name}.join(&lsquo;, &rsquo;)}&rdquo;
board.cards.each do |card|</p>

<pre><code>  puts "- \"#{card.name}\""
  puts "-- Actions: #{card.actions.nil? ? 0 : card.actions.count}"
  puts "-- Members: #{card.members.count}"
  puts "-- Labels: #{card.labels.count}"
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>Wow, cool! Such data! This is really great for a single user because we only have to make the connection to Trello once (which is not incredibly fast). However, this won&rsquo;t work in a multi-user environment since we configured ruby-trello to use a specific member token. So how do we connect to multiple members at a time? Let&rsquo;s print out the same data we did above for a single user, but using <code>Trello::Client</code> to connect to Trello.</p>

<p>``` ruby client_test.rb
require &lsquo;trello&rsquo;</p>

<p>me = Trello::Client.new(
  :developer_public_key => ENV[&lsquo;PUBLIC_KEY&rsquo;],
  :member_token => ENV[&lsquo;MY_MEMBER_TOKEN&rsquo;]
)</p>

<p>you = Trello::Client.new(
  :developer_public_key => ENV[&lsquo;PUBLIC_KEY&rsquo;],
  :member_token => ENV[&lsquo;YOUR_MEMBER_TOKEN&rsquo;]
)</p>

<p>[me, you].each do |user|
  puts user.fullname
  board = user.boards.first
  puts board.name
  puts &ldquo;Lists: #{board.lists.map {|x| x.name}.join(&lsquo;, &rsquo;)}&rdquo;
  puts &ldquo;Members: #{board.members.map {|x| x.full_name}.join(&lsquo;, &rsquo;)}&rdquo;
  board.cards.each do |card|</p>

<pre><code>    puts "- \"#{card.name}\""
    puts "-- Actions: #{card.actions.nil? ? 0 : card.actions.count}"
    puts "-- Members: #{card.members.count}"
    puts "-- Labels: #{card.labels.count}"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Now, as your friend and teacher, I command you to use this knowledge to go <a href="//ollert.herokuapp.com">do cool stuff</a> with Trello!</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/02/22/using-x-editable-to-do-in-line-editing-for-you/"/>

    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/02/22/using-x-editable-to-do-in-line-editing-for-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In-line editing is traditionally difficult. Taking a static HTML node and turning it into an editable text field and then sending that data off somewhere is a little bit more Javascript than I like to write. My team and I came up against a very difficult UX problem which I spent over a week trying to understand. After building and discussing several solutions, we eventually decided to narrow the scope of what the user should be able to change. We would present the user with a table where one of the columns would be editable.</p>

<p>Rather than showing a table with the third column always as a field for text entry, I used the Javascript library <a href="//vitalets.github.io/x-editable/">X-editable</a>. X-editable allows me to display my editable item as a link. When the user clicks the item, the link turns into a text field with a Save/Cancel button (and a &lsquo;clear&rsquo; button as a bonus). The &lsquo;Save&rsquo; button submits an AJAX &lsquo;POST&rsquo; or &lsquo;PUTS&rsquo;, where we are then allowed to validate and save the data. The &lsquo;Cancel&rsquo; button turns the text field back into a link with the original value.</p>

<p>Hooray, someone else has already done the hard work for us! So, what I want to do is dynamically generate a table with objects and allow the user to edit one of the columns. In my case, only the end column is editable, but I could just as easily spread this availability to all my columns. I&rsquo;m using all my favorite tools to create this page, specifically <a href="//ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby</a>, <a href="//sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, <a href="//getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, and <a href="//haml.info">HAML</a>.</p>

<p>X-editable has implementations using Bootstrap, jQuery UI, and jQuery. Since I&rsquo;m already using Bootstrap in my app, I&rsquo;m going to go with that version. Note that there are Bootstrap 2 and Bootstrap 3 builds of X-editable, and I&rsquo;m using the Bootstrap 3 variety.</p>

<p>First I include the necessary files at the top of my HAML document.</p>

<p>``` haml /views/manage_data.haml
%script{src: &ldquo;//code.jquery.com/jquery.js&rdquo;}
%script{src: &ldquo;//getbootstrap.com/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js&rdquo;}
%link{href: &ldquo;//getbootstrap.com/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&rdquo;, rel: &ldquo;stylesheet&rdquo;}</p>

<p>%link{href: &ldquo;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/x-editable/1.5.0/bootstrap3-editable/css/bootstrap-editable.css&rdquo;, rel: &ldquo;stylesheet&rdquo;}
%script{src: &ldquo;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/x-editable/1.5.0/bootstrap3-editable/js/bootstrap-editable.min.js&rdquo;}
```</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to dumb my page down so I only have to show the important parts. I&rsquo;m going to create a table from an array of hashes called <code>@options</code>. Each hash has two important fields for this table: Points and Dollars. I will iterate over <code>@options</code>, displaying the <code>points</code> field as plain text and the <code>dollars</code> field as an X-editable link. Each hash also has a <code>value</code> field containing the primary key for the object to be edited.</p>

<p>``` haml /views/manage_data.haml
.container
  .row</p>

<pre><code>.col-md-6
  %table{id: "edit_points_goal", class: "table table-responsive table-hover table-bordered"}
    %thead
      %tr
        %th{width: "35%"}
          Points
        %th{width: "65%"}
          Dollars
    %tbody
      - @options.each do |option|
        %tr
          %td{style: "height: 45px; padding: 4px 8px; vertical-align: middle;"}
            #{option[:points]}
          %td{style: "height: 45px; padding: 4px 8px; vertical-align: middle;"}
            %a{href:"javascript:void(0)", "data-type"=&gt;"text", "data-pk"=&gt;"#{option[:value]}", "data-url"=&gt;"/update", "data-title"=&gt;"Enter dollar amount"}
              #{option[:dollars]}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The important part is the <code>a</code> tag:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>href</code> goes nowhere.</li>
<li><code>data-type</code> tells X-editable how it will edit the presented data. According to the docs, types include text, textarea, select, date, checklist and more.</li>
<li><code>data-pk</code> is the primary key of our data in the database. In my case, that comes to me stored in the <code>value</code> field of the option hash.</li>
<li><code>data-url</code> is the <code>post</code> method that will be used to interpret the data.</li>
<li><code>data-title</code> is used to tell the user what to do.</li>
</ul>


<p>Our code won&rsquo;t do anything yet seeing as it&rsquo;s not connected. We need some Javascript to do that. I put the Javascript at the top of my file, underneath the included files. The first thing we need to do is tell X-editable what type of editing we&rsquo;ll be doing. The options are in-line editing or a pop-up. I want the in-line editing in this case. The second thing I want to do is to set the <code>editable</code> attribute on the appropriate DOM objects. Since I&rsquo;m using an array, I found the easiest way to do this was to start at the table&rsquo;s id (edit_points_goal) and trace down to the <code>a</code> tag.</p>

<p>``` haml /views/manage_data.haml
:javascript
  $.fn.editable.defaults.mode = &lsquo;inline&rsquo;;</p>

<p>  $(document).ready(function() {</p>

<pre><code>if (#{vm.editable}) {
  $('#edit_points_goal tbody tr td a').editable();
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });
```</p>

<p>Now we need to deal with the <code>post</code> request. If you&rsquo;re really impatient to see things work, you should be able to see your in-line editable code in action, but the <code>post</code> call will fail with a &ldquo;NoMethodError.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our <code>post</code> is going to be really simple. We verify that we have a non-negative integer and we either save and return 200 or we return 400 with an appropriate message. Our table in this example is just called <code>Data</code>, and we use <code>find</code> to get a value out of the database.</p>

<p>``` ruby web.rb
post &ldquo;/update&rdquo; do
  data = Data.find(id: params[&ldquo;pk&rdquo;])</p>

<p>  unless params[&ldquo;value&rdquo;].match(/[^0-9]/)</p>

<pre><code>data = params["value"].to_i
data.save
return 200
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  return {400, [], &ldquo;Please enter a valid non-negative number&rdquo;}
end
```</p>

<p>Things should be working now. When you enter good data and click the &lsquo;Ok&rsquo; button, our <code>post</code> will be called and the text field will turn back into a link. When you enter bad data, you should see our error message below the text field box.</p>

<p>Issues I encountered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table column width shifting &ndash; Fixed by setting the widths explicitly, as seen above (35% and 65%).</li>
<li>Table height shifting &ndash; Fixed by setting the style of the <code>td</code> as seen above to give a larger height, more padding, and aligning the inner objects explicitly. I would recommend moving this definition to a <code>.css</code> or <code>.scss</code> file.</li>
<li>&ldquo;NoMethodError&rdquo; after clicking Go &ndash; Unfortunately, if you made any coding errors in your route, you won&rsquo;t be able to see the Sinatra error page but will instead you&rsquo;ll be presented with a giant wall of HTML below the text box. Try to parse this error, but if you struggle to find out what went wrong you can always substitute a form-post method in place of the <code>a</code> tag, which may allow you to more easily figure out the problem.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <a href="//vitalets.github.io/x-editable/docs.html">X-editable docs</a> are extremely helpful for beginners. There is even more detail on the X-editable site, including editing multiple items, editing dates, and using a pop-up to edit the data.</p>

    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2014/02/22/convincing-rvm-to-let-you-use-ruby-2-dot-1-0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="//ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/12/25/ruby-2-1-0-is-released/">Ruby 2.1.0 went stable</a> a few months ago, and <a href="//ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/01/10/ruby-1-9-3-will-end-on-2015/">Ruby 1.9.3 support</a> will end in a just over a year.</p>

<p>You know what that means: Warplanes in the sky falling to the ground, dogs and cats getting along like old pals, and people wandering aimlessly through the streets trying to remember the last time they saw a green build.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, all of these things can be prevented. Once upon a time, I wrote about <a href="/blog/2013/10/08/rvm-quick-start/">configuring and using rvm</a> to control individual ruby environments for each of your projects. If it&rsquo;s been a while since you installed your copy of <a href="//rvm.io/">rvm</a>, you might have some trouble installing and using newer version of ruby. Lucky for us, those clever rvm developers made it easy to get around this.</p>

<p>In my case, I want to upgrade a project to use <code>ruby 2.1.0</code>. The first time I tried to run <code>rvm install ruby-2.1.0</code>, I ended up installing <code>ruby-2.1.0-preview1</code>. I realized that I had installed rvm on this machine around October 2013, and <code>ruby 2.1.0</code> was released in December 2013, so rvm had no idea that <code>ruby 2.1.0</code> was stable. Updating rvm (in the root of the project directory):</p>

<p><code>bash /home/lrp/Projects/2014/projNeedingRuby210
$ rvm get stable
</code></p>

<p>There will be some amount of text on the screen if your system needs to be updated. Note that you must be connected to the internet if you want rvm to update. Now we do the install of our brand new ruby:</p>

<p><code>bash /home/lrp/Projects/2014/projNeedingRuby210
$ rvm install ruby-2.1.0
</code></p>

<p>Again, text on the screen from fetching of data from the internet. But hopefully you see something that tells you the operation was successful. You can also verify which rubies you have installed using the <code>list</code> command:</p>

<p>``` bash /home/lrp/Projects/2014/projNeedingRuby210
$ rvm list rubies
   ruby-1.9.3-p448 [ x86_64 ]
=> ruby-2.0.0-p247 [ x86_64 ]
 * ruby-2.1.0 [ x86_64 ]</p>

<h1>=> &ndash; current</h1>

<h1>=* &ndash; current &amp;&amp; default</h1>

<h1>* &ndash; default</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now we tell our current project to use <code>ruby 2.1.0</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash /home/lrp/Projects/2014/projNeedingRuby210
$ rm .ruby-version .ruby-gemset
$ rvm 2.1.0@projNeedingRuby210 --create --ruby-version
ruby-2.1.0 - #gemset created /home/lrp/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0@projNeedingRuby210
ruby-2.1.0 - #generating projNeedingRuby210 wrappers.
$ rvm gemset copy 2.0.0-p247@projNeedingRuby210 2.1.0@projNeedingRuby210
Copying gemset from 2.0.0-p247@projNeedingRuby210 to 2.1.0@projNeedingRuby210
Generating gemset wrappers ruby-2.1.0@projNeedingRuby210.
Making gemset 2.1.0@projNeedingRuby210 pristine.
$ which ruby
/home/lrp/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/bin/ruby
</code></p>

<p>Alright! Crisis averted. If you&rsquo;re using <a href="//bundler.io/">bundler</a> with this project, be sure to change your ruby version (usually located near the top of the <code>Gemfile</code>).</p>

<p>What about setting up a new project using <code>ruby 2.1.0</code>? Easy! Switch to the project directory and:</p>

<p><code>bash /home/lrp/Projects/2014/newRubyProject
$ rvm 2.1.0@newRubyProject --create --ruby-version
</code></p>

<p>Oh, rvm, you make life <em>too</em> easy sometimes.</p>

    <link href="http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/10/08/rvm-quick-start/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-08T22:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://larry-price.com/blog/2013/10/08/rvm-quick-start</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was working on a few different projects at once, I started running into issues where my Ruby gem versions would start to mismatch. How did I fix that issue? Naively. I adjusted the versions as necessary so my gems were always the same version. That was&hellip; pretty dumb. To make up for my past ignorance, I&rsquo;ve been exploring ways to manage my Ruby versions and my gems intelligently. Enter <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>.</p>

<p>RVM is a simple tool to solve just problems. And it works pretty well. I hit some kinks along the way, but my installation pleases me well enough. Getting RVM is not for the faint of heart. Maybe there are better ways to do it, but the website says to execute the following:</p>

<p>``` bash /home/lrp/my_project</p>

<blockquote><p>curl -L <a href="https://get.rvm.io">https://get.rvm.io</a> | bash -s stable
```</p></blockquote>

<p>This command uses curl to fetch the data that lives at <code>https://get.rvm.io</code>, which happens to be a big bash script. It executes the bash script with the args <code>-s stable</code>. &lsquo;Stable&rsquo; means the latest stable release of RVM. I could just as easily give it &lsquo;dev&rsquo; and get the latest developer release instead, but I really don&rsquo;t want that. So that command does a lot of stuff and may give you some further instructions to run before you can continue. Use that big head of yours and follow the instructions. You may also need to restart a terminal to get RVM to be recognized as a command. Since I was using <code>gnome-terminal</code>, I had to follow these <a href="https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal">instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Now I want RVM to know about some Ruby versions. For a full list of possible Ruby versions to install, run <code>rvm list known</code>. I just want 1.9.3. I found that I needed to do this even though I had 1.9.3 installed on my system previously.</p>

<p>``` bash /home/lrp/my_project</p>

<blockquote><p>rvm install ruby-1.9.3
```</p></blockquote>

<p>In Ubuntu 13.04, this command installs ruby-1.9.3 in <code>~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p448/bin/ruby</code>. I&rsquo;ve found that this also sets my default Ruby to the RVM version of Ruby, which I don&rsquo;t want. To verify and undo this, I executed the following commands outside of my project directory.</p>

<p>``` bash /home/lrp</p>

<blockquote><p>which ruby
/home/lrp/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p448/bin/ruby
echo &ldquo;D'oh&rdquo;
D'oh
rvm use system
Now using system ruby.
which ruby
/usr/bin/ruby</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>Now that that&rsquo;s settled, I want to tell RVM to use the local version of Ruby for my project and to install any gems in a special location.</p>

<p>``` bash /home/lrp/my_project</p>

<blockquote><p>rvm 1.9.3@my-project &mdash;create &mdash;ruby-version
```</p></blockquote>

<p>This creates a gemset and ruby-version file (<code>.ruby-gemset</code> and <code>.ruby-version</code> files) using the Ruby installation 1.9.3 created above. I specifiy to use <code>--ruby-version</code> instead of <code>--rvmrc</code> because RVM told me that I should. After some research, the <code>.ruby-version</code> file is used by several other tools, so this will keep my potential number of config files low. Now I check that all my Ruby versions are okay.</p>

<p>``` bash /home/lrp/my_project</p>

<blockquote><p>which ruby
/home/lrp/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p448/bin/ruby
cd ..
which ruby
/usr/bin/ruby</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>When in my project directory, all the gems I install will be installed to my specified gemset, which means they are no longer cluttering my global gemspace, even when I install them using Bundler. It also means that I can use ruby-1.9.3 for this project and 2.0 for another project with minimal mental overhead. This makes me a happy developer.</p>

<p>I only glazed over the installation process and documentation for RVM. Go to <a href="https://rvm.io/">the web site</a> for more.</p>
