<div class="entry-content"><p>Happy New Year, dear reader.</p>

<p>2014 was a fairly good year for me. I wrote a lot of code, read a lot of books, and published a lot of blog posts.</p>

<h3>Things I got paid to do</h3>

<p>2014 was a reaffirmation of career goals alongside the opportunities to work with several very different clients. In addition to working on cool stuff, I was promoted to Software Engineer 2. During the tail end of the year, I had the chance to work from home part of the week, which was a great experience. A sampling of my professional works this year:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wrapped up my time writing Qt/C++ for a touch-screen automated-guidance system embedded in heavy machinery. I spent the first two months of the year playing Tech Lead for a small team of misfits leaving the project during an organizational restructure. I had the opportunity to work directly with a project architect to redesign features and guide my fellow developers through the implementation.</li>
<li>I worked on <a href="https://h2w.cc">Health2Wealth</a>, a ruby application created by some work friends to track Fitbit data and allow an administrator to award monetary rewards for reaching goals.</li>
<li>I pitched, designed, and implemented a product called <a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>, a Trello analysis tool written in ruby. Built during a 48-hour <a href="http://www.sep.com/labs/startupweekend/">SEP Startup Weekend</a>, I led a team of 6 to bring the project to fruition. SEP has fully embraced the product and I continue to work on <a href="/blog/2014/12/02/ollert-6-months-later/">improving it</a> when not on project work. We currently get about 300 sessions a month, and I frequently get emails from users thanking me, reporting bugs, or submitting feature requests.</li>
<li>I became part of a team of developers working on a modern asset-tracking tool to replace an existing Microsoft Access tool. This was my introduction to C# programming with ASP.NET MVC. The project was short-lived for my team, but sparked my interests in RESTful APIs and Javascript.</li>
<li>I worked on a rewrite of a huge WebForms e-commerce site. We created a hybrid site running some pages in the WebForms engine and all of our new pages in fresh MVC. We worked with a high-fidelity prototype created by an outside company, which proved at times invaluable and at other times a thorn in our sides. We worked directly with members of the client on-site, who were able to provide us with great insights into the legacy system and helped us work out unclear requirements.</li>
<li>In December, I had some fun working on a solo proof-of-concept with a new client. This client is planning to do a rewrite of a large application in 2015 and wanted to do some investigation into rules engines, particularly those using Java. I worked through a few libraries and landed on JBoss Drools, an open-source rules engine with an integrated frontend called KIE Workbench. It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote any Java code, and I&rsquo;d certainly never deployed any Java web applications. After two weeks of work, I was able to launch a web application using Spring MVC and integrate a KIE Workbench instance running on the same Azure virtual machine. The application is able to pick up rule changes from the Workbench automatically, without recompilation or redeployment.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Of my own volition</h3>

<p>I had a lot of fun coding ideas this year, most of them lost to the raptures of time. A few items of note:</p>

<ul>
<li>BYO Game of Life (<a href="http://byo-game-of-life.herokuapp.com">http://byo-game-of-life.herokuapp.com</a>)

<ul>
<li>My most recent release - a frontend web client allowing the user to give a URL pointing to a Game of Life backend. I created a <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/game-of-life-impl">Go implementation</a> as part of my presentation for the inaugural <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Indy-Golang/events/219199103/">Indy Golang meetup</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3rd Day Organics

<ul>
<li>We finally finished version 1.0 of 3DO, a custom e-commerce website for a co-worker&rsquo;s spouse&rsquo;s cooperative food program. We built the whole application from scratch; in hindsight, we should have set something up using <a href="https://spreecommerce.com">spree</a> or another commerce framework.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fortune Cookie API (<a href="http://fortunecookieapi.com">http://fortunecookieapi.com</a>)

<ul>
<li>A fairly silly API written using NodeJS to get data associated with fortune cookies: fortunes, lessons in Chinese, and lottery numbers. I implemented a simple application to access the data at <a href="http://demo.fortunecookieapi.com">http://demo.fortunecookieapi.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mongoose-simple-random (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-simple-random">https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-simple-random</a>)

<ul>
<li>My foray into NodeJS packages - this is a plugin which adds <code>findRandom</code> and <code>findOneRandom</code> methods to any mongoose schema. Used extensively in the Fortune Cookie API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ollert (<a href="https://ollertapp.com">https://ollertapp.com</a>)

<ul>
<li>I know I listed it under a paid project, but I was putting over 8 hours a week into Ollert between the time it was originally built and the time I was paid to work on it. It&rsquo;s my big pet project, and I&rsquo;m proud of the things that it and I have accomplished. Trello has noted our accomplishments, validating all the hard work and long hours I&rsquo;d sunk into it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Book It - Where&rsquo;s my free pizza?</h3>

<p>I think that I read 11 books this year. See my <a href="/blog/books">books section</a> for a quick check of which books you should be reading. Some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/14coDAd">Rework</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1rzTsZH">Remote</a> by Jason Fried</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/14coIUG">Punished by Rewards</a> by Alfie Kohn</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1tAMWU0">The XX Factor</a> by Alison Wolf</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1Ai3mBk">The Lean Startup</a> by Eric Ries</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1x4jaXh">Made to Stick</a> by Chip Heath</li>
</ul>


<h3>This blog o' mine</h3>

<p>In reality, I put quite a bit of work into this blog.</p>

<p>I published <strong>24 blog posts in 2013</strong>; I published <strong>37 in 2014</strong> (including this one).</p>

<p>I had <strong>1700 sessions and 2420 pageviews in 2013</strong>. I did almost that well in a single month at the end of 2014. I had <strong>10,194 sessions and 12,997 pageviews in 2014</strong> (as of 10:46AM EST 12/31/2014).</p>

<p>In February, I set up a custom domain at &ldquo;larry-price.com&rdquo;. Since then, <a href="/blog/2014/12/14/migrating-an-octopress-blog-from-github-pages-to-openshift/">I moved from Github Pages to OpenShift</a> and added SSL.</p>

<p>I integrated Google AdSense this summer. Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;earned&rdquo; $3.78 in the past 6 months. From my perspective, these ads are simply an experiment to see how I could potentially monetize this blog. Another experiment was posting Amazon Associate links with my <a href="/blog/categories/write-ups">write-up posts</a>; I&rsquo;ve gotten 4 clicks and 0 buys.</p>

<p>In an attempt to keep people on the site &ldquo;longer&rdquo;, I added a Related Posts section above the Comments - it makes the blog take forever to generate and has had negligible results. It turns out users are more likely to click the related tags than the related posts. I intend to remove the Related Posts section soon (it may not be there when you read this).</p>

<h3>Hello, 2015</h3>

<p>As I enter the new year, I want to be able to look back next year at a set of naïve goals and wonder why I ever thought they were practical. So here they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contribute meaningful code to several open source projects not created by me</li>
<li>Read at least 1 book per month</li>
<li>Attend more meetups

<ul>
<li>As a note, I am in fact <em>starting</em> a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Indy-Golang">meetup for Google Go in Indianapolis</a> starting on January 6, 2015. This goal may actually be attainable!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&gt;3000 sessions/month on this blog (currently ~1400)</li>
<li>Become pro at using chopsticks

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m already pretty good, but by the end of 2015 I will be eating pizza with chopsticks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More effectively conceal emotions when working with peers and clients

<ul>
<li>Use this energy and passion to put the situation in my control instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work remotely more and better</li>
<li>Obtain more technical leadership roles on projects

<ul>
<li>Not entirely in my control, I know, but I&rsquo;m hoping that 2015 is a year where I&rsquo;m able to demonstrate both my technical skills and proclivity to command</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Goodbye, 2014</h3>

<p>Thanks for reading. Have you thought about doing one of these yourself? You really should! There&rsquo;s lots of help out there if you need it - you can even reach out to me, if you like.</p>

<p>As always, may your compile times be short and your error messages meaningful.</p>
