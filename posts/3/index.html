  <div class="entry-content"><p>The release of Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak in the coming months will bring about the public release of Unity 8 as a pre-installed desktop session (though not as the default session). It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, and there&rsquo;s a lot of new features which will break older applications. Canonical has unveiled <a href="http://snapcraft.io">snappy</a> as the preferred packaging system for Unity 8, but what about all those old deb packages?</p>

<p>There have been a few other good posts about X applications on Unity 8 including <a href="http://mhall119.com/2016/05/dogfooding-unity-8/">this one on dogfooding</a>, <a href="https://kylenubuntu.blogspot.no/2016/07/running-x-apps-on-ubuntu-devices.html">this one on Ubuntu Touch</a>, and <a href="https://bregmatter.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/x11-applications-and-unity-8/">this one on how it works under the covers</a>. This blog post is explicitly about Unity 8 on desktop using the Libertine CLI, though can be applied to most devices running Ubuntu Touch.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Canonical on one of the teams making all of this fancy stuff work.</em></p>

<h3>A (Very) Brief Explanation</h3>

<p>The toolchain we&rsquo;ll be relying on is called <code>libertine</code>, and it&rsquo;s essentially a wrapper around unprivileged LXC and chroot-based containers. We prefer to use LXC containers on newer OSes, but we must continue supporting chroot containers on many devices due to kernel limitations.</p>

<h3>What You&rsquo;ll Need</h3>

<p>For desktop Unity 8, you&rsquo;ll need the packages for <code>libertine</code>, <code>libertine-tools</code>, and <code>lxc</code> to get started. This will install a CLI and GUI for maintaining Libertine containers and applications.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re running Wily or newer, you can just run the following in your terminal:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt install libertine
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll need to add the stable overlay PPA first:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ci-train-ppa-service/stable-phone-overlay
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install libertine
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>The GUI</h3>

<p>At this point, if you&rsquo;re on desktop you can open up the GUI which will guide you through creating a new container and installing applications. Search the Dash (or Apps scope) for <code>libertine</code> and, given that we haven&rsquo;t pushed a buggy version recently, you&rsquo;ll be presented with a Qt application for maintaining containers. I highly recommend using the GUI, because then you are guaranteed not to be following out-of-date console commands.</p>

<p>&hellip;But maybe you prefer the terminal. Or maybe you&rsquo;re secretly SSH&rsquo;d into the target machine or Ubuntu Touch device and need to use the terminal. If so&hellip;</p>

<h3>The CLI</h3>

<p>The CLI we&rsquo;ll be using is <code>libertine-container-manager</code>. It has a <code>manpage</code>, a <code>--help</code> option, and autocomplete to help you out in a jam.</p>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is create a container. There are a lot of options, but to create an optimal container for your current machine you only need to specify the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> parameters:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>libertine-container-manager create --id desktopapps --name <span class="s2">&quot;Desktop Applications&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A couple of things to note here: Your <code>id</code> must be unique and conform to the simple click name regex - this is what will identify your container on a system level. The <code>name</code> should be human-readable so you can easily identify what might be inside your container. If you don&rsquo;t specify a <code>name</code>, your <code>id</code> will be used. The CLI will likely ask you for a password to use in the container in case you ever need it. You can leave this blank if you&rsquo;re not concerned with that kind of thing.</p>

<p>At this point, a bunch of things should be happening in your terminal. This will pull a container image for your current distro and install all the requirements to get started maintaining and running X apps. This could take anywhere from a few minutes to the next hour depending on your network and disk speeds. Once you&rsquo;re done, you can use the <code>list</code> subcommand to list all installed containers (note you probably just have one at this point). If you ever want to delete your container, you can run <code>libertine-container-manager destroy -i desktopapps</code>.</p>

<p>Once that&rsquo;s finished, we can start installing apps. To find apps available, you can use the <code>search-cache</code> subcommand:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>libertine-container-manager search-cache --id desktopapps --search-string <span class="s2">&quot;office&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will return a few strings from the apt-cache of the container with <code>id</code> &ldquo;desktopapps&rdquo; that match &ldquo;office&rdquo;. Now, if you want to install &ldquo;libreoffice&rdquo;:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>libertine-container-manager install-package --id desktopapps --package libreoffice
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will install the full libreoffice suite. Nice! Similarly, you can use the <code>remove-package</code> subcommand to remove applications. Don&rsquo;t remember what apps you&rsquo;ve installed? Use the <code>list-apps</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>libertine-container-manager list-apps --id desktopapps
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re an avid Steam for Linux gamer and want to try to get some games working. Since Steam still only comes in a 32-bit binary, you&rsquo;ll need to enable the multiarch repos, and then you can just install Steam like any other app:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>libertine-container-manager configure --id desktopapps --multiarch <span class="nb">enable</span>
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>libertine-container-manager install-package --id desktopapps --package steam
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Steam will ask you to agree to their user agreement from the command line, which you should be able to do easily. If you need to use the <code>readline</code> frontend for dpkg, you can append <code>--readline</code> to the <code>install-package</code> command to enable it.</p>

<p>There are many other commands to explore to maintain your container, but for now I&rsquo;ll let you check the manpage or open the GUI to explore further.</p>

<h3>Running Apps</h3>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve installed some apps, you probably want to run them. You can install the Libertine Scope, which will allow you to peruse your installed apps in a Unity 8 session. You can either install it from the App Store on a device (search for &ldquo;Desktop Apps Scope&rdquo;) or through <code>apt</code> on desktop with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt install libertine-scope
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In a Unity 8 session, you can now find the scope and click on apps to run them. Note that there are many apps which still don&rsquo;t work, such as those requiring a terminal or <code>sudo</code>; consider these a work in progress.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been toiling away the past few weeks getting a scope ready which can be used explicitly to install/remove X apps in Unity 8, like the current Ubuntu Software Center (or app store on Touch devices). This scope should be available anywhere the libertine scope is available, meaning that it will alleviate a lot of the pain associated with installing/removing apps for a large chunk of users. Using the Libertine GUI or Libertine CLI will still allow for much more customization, but those tools are largely designed with power users in mind.</p>

<p>Are you able to get libertine working on your system? Can you launch X applications to your heart&rsquo;s content? Let me know in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is the third in a series of blog posts detailing my experience acclimating to a fully remote work experience. You may also enjoy my original posts <a href="/blog/2016/04/11/going-remote-1-week/">detailing my first week</a> and <a href="/blog/2016/05/05/going-remote-1-month-in/">my first month</a>.</em></p>

<p>Has it really been 4 months since I started riding the raging river of remote work? After my first month, I felt pretty good about my daily schedule and work/life balance. Since the last post, I&rsquo;ve met many of my co-workers IRL, learned to find my own work, and figured out how to shake things up when I get in a rut.</p>

<h3>But First, Did I Handle My Action Items?</h3>

<p>During my first month, I struggled to figure out what to work on after finishing a task. At this point, it&rsquo;s extremely rare that I don&rsquo;t have a dozen things in the queue like a pile of papers in an In Box about to topple over. I am happily busy all the time, either pulling things off the top of the stack, plucking things from the middle, or coming up with some new feature that I need to add.</p>

<p>I feel a lot more comfortable on chat. Our IRC channels are a bit daunting at first, especially when there&rsquo;s a lot of action going on. I&rsquo;ve learned some good ways to interject or reach out to the people that I need to talk to.</p>

<p>Oh, and I still haven&rsquo;t gotten a new floormat. Yes, this one&rsquo;s still broken. For some reason, it just doesn&rsquo;t annoy me as much as it used to. It&rsquo;s almost endearing: like a three-legged puppy that I roll my chair across and stand on top of for 8 hours a day.</p>

<h3>Meeting IRL</h3>

<blockquote><p>Why would you guys actually meet IRL? - Elliot, <em>Mr Robot</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I know a bunch of my coworkers by IRC nicks, and I see a few of their faces in a Google Hangout for our daily standup. This has been sufficient for me, but we did something truly magical in June. We met IRL.</p>

<p>The team I&rsquo;m on (~10 people) and our sibling team (~10 people) met in Montréal, Québec, Canada, for about a week, and it was unlike any meeting-of-the-minds I&rsquo;ve ever been to. The engineers were largely from the US and Europe. We all stayed in the hotel downtown and used a small conference room to hang out and work all day, every day. We woke up and ate breakfast together, met in the conference room at 9, had snacks and coffee, ate lunch together, stopped working precisely at 6, and met back in the lobby a few minutes later to go out on the town until 11 or midnight. It&rsquo;s a truly intense social experience, especially for a group of people who spend most of their days only interacting with other humans through IRC, <em>especially</em> for a group of people who only meet twice a year or so.</p>

<p>This coming together allowed us to hash out a lot of our plans for the coming months, but I believe the true victory in this type of event is the camaraderie it creates. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to put faces to nicks, think about the inflection in a person&rsquo;s voice coming out in the way they type, and know exactly who I need to ping on IRC to accomplish certain tasks. It&rsquo;s fun to hang out with people from all over the world, and it&rsquo;s fun to go drinking with your coworkers, a thing I had temporarily forgotten.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll note that we also happened to be in Montréal during the 23rd annual Mondial de la Biere, a huge international beer festival that lasted several days. I&rsquo;ll also note that it was fun to try to speak little bits of French in Montréal, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to wherever the next sprint abroad may take us (most likely Europe in October).</p>

<h3>Finding Work</h3>

<p>With a decentralized company, the issue of finding things to work on for new employees can be tough. Do you give them something small and easy and possibly belittling? Do you give them something massive that will leave them scratching their heads for weeks and completely out of touch with the rest of the company? How can you find a good middle ground here?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say I was &ldquo;eased in&rdquo; with smaller tasks into my current project. After the first few tasks were completed, it was often unclear to me where I should go next. There was always a list of bugs - was I the right person to work on them? Was there any other impending feature or unlisted bug that I should start looking into instead? These are hard questions for someone who hasn&rsquo;t been around for very long.</p>

<p>Over time, I gained more and more responsibilities. I needed a bug fixed pronto in another project, so I did it myself and submitted an MP. Oh, you understand this codebase? You can be a maintainer now! Oh, I think I remember from your resume that you have some golang experience. We need this fixed ASAP, using SD cards is completely broken without it!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all a slippery slope to having a bottomless bucket of super-interesting things to choose from to do work, perform code reviews, and answer community questions. Yet <em>somehow</em> it&rsquo;s all happened in a way that is not overwhelming, but freeing. When I get stuck on a problem or need a short break from my current project, there&rsquo;s plenty of other work to go around. Which leads me to&hellip;</p>

<h3>Shaking Things Up</h3>

<p>Routine can be helpful, but it can also be terrible. For the parts of May and June that I wasn&rsquo;t traveling, I was largely waking up at the same time, making the same lunch, listening to the same music every day, petting the same cats, and picking up the same kinds of tasks from the backlog. None of this was bad <em>per se</em>, but I found myself getting a tad sluggish. It would be harder to work on menial tasks, and easier to come up with elaborate solutions to simple problems. So what did I do?</p>

<p>I started varying my sleep schedule. Some days I get out of bed at 7, other days I get out of bed at 8:45. Because I work from home, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about fighting traffic or skipping breakfast.</p>

<p>I started varying my lunches. I was making some fun rissotto recipes, but since it&rsquo;s summer I&rsquo;ve been mixing up a bunch of different vegetables into a menagerie of salads: sauteed green tomatoes, onions, and zucchini; cukes and onions; pineapple, succotash, and eggs.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve gained more responsibilities for various projects, I&rsquo;ve been able to branch into different kinds of tasks. After finishing up a big rework of one codebase, I can start jumping into bugs somewhere else. I can dig deep somewhere, and pivot when I&rsquo;m ready to go back. There&rsquo;s always something interesting to work on, and I can see the way different tasks help us towards our end goal. Not to mention I can <em>always</em> do bug hunts.</p>

<h3>Remote Life 4-eva</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just working remotely that makes this possible - it&rsquo;s the people, the culture, and the fun and interesting products we&rsquo;re creating. Maybe I&rsquo;ll start blogging more about those things in the future. I don&rsquo;t have much in this area that I&rsquo;m looking to improve on, so this could be the last post in the series. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do one at the 1-year mark to note any new tricks I&rsquo;ve learned. Until then, keep looking our for other non-diary-entry blog posts.</p>

<p>Looking for advice on working remotely? Not sure if you&rsquo;d like it? Do you have a strong disagreement with me as a person or my lifestyle choices? Hit me up and we can chat!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thinking about writing an Ubuntu application that will work in Unity 8? You&rsquo;ll be writing a &ldquo;convergent&rdquo; app, which is an application that can respond to touch or mouse, and will adapt appropriately to a phone, tablet, or desktop screen. It will even be able to update its display on-the-fly if, say, you plug your phone into a monitor or bluetooth keyboard.</p>

<p>There are <em>lots</em> of ways to write a convergent application with the <a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/platform/sdk/">Ubuntu SDK</a>. You can build apps in pure QML, C++ with QML, QtQuick, pure HTML5/Javascript, or even <strong>Golang with QML</strong>. We&rsquo;ll be focusing on go apps for the rest of this post.</p>

<p>Go is a young language, and the recent release of <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.6">go 1.6</a> has introduced some nasty changes particularly involving cgo. It has also introduced vendoring by default, which is a welcome change.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using go 1.6.2. For me, the current project template provided by the Ubuntu SDK feels quite broken. I can&rsquo;t get things to build locally, and furthermore I see no options for pushing an ARM build to my device.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I found this <a href="https://github.com/nikwen/ubuntu-go-qml-template">ubuntu-go-qml-template</a> which is a template to enable running/building a go/qml application locally while also supporting building/installing onto an arm device. The kicker? This tool was designed to work for go 1.3.3. Sigh! Since I&rsquo;m unwilling to compromise and use old technology, I <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/ubuntu-go-qml-template">forked the project</a> and updated it to fit my more modern needs.</p>

<p>Because our go template will depend on QML, we depend on the <a href="https://github.com/go-qml/qml">go-qml</a> project to create the necessary C bindings to allow us to use QML. However, with the update to go 1.6, the current version (revision 2ee7e5f) of go-qml will give a runtime error from cgo with the wonderfully helpful <code>panic: runtime error: cgo argument has Go pointer to Go pointer</code>. Another thorn in our side. Fortunately, this issue is in previously tread-upon ground and there is a <a href="https://github.com/sjb/qml/tree/go1.6-port">fork of go-qml</a> with enough of the cgo issues fixed to run our application with no problems. In the <code>ubuntu-go-qml-template</code> I forked above, I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and vendored this fork of <code>go-qml</code>. It all works because of the default vendoring available in go 1.6.</p>

<p>With that background out of the way, let&rsquo;s run through getting a project started:</p>

<p>You may need to have other dependencies including <code>click</code> or <code>phablet-tools</code>. The above commands installed dependencies, cloned the repo, and built and/or updated a chroot for building our source for arm.</p>

<p>Next you&rsquo;ll want to setup the project for your own needs. The original template creator included a nifty <code>setup</code> script to get this done:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>                   -d <span class="s2">&quot;your-developer-namespace&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will do some fancy gsub and file renaming to make the template your own.</p>

<p>If you check <code>src/</code>, you&rsquo;ll find a <code>main.go</code> file ready for your use. You&rsquo;ll also find a <code>main.qml</code> file in <code>share/qml/</code>. You can vendor all of your dependencies in <code>vendor/</code>, where you&rsquo;ll already find the <code>qml</code> package.</p>

<p>As far as getting your application to work, there are more scripts available:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./build.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># this will build your project locally</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./run.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># this will build your project locally and then run it on the desktop</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The best part about this template is the ability to build for arm and load your applications onto a device:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./build-in-chroot.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># builds the package using the vivid+armhf chroot we set up previously</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># the first USB-connected Ubuntu Touch device</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can run and install go/qml applications on desktop or on devices. Time to go build something cool!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Gist</h3>

<p>How can one man give the world so much? Scott Meyers transformed my understanding of C++ with <a href="/blog/2013/07/16/effective-c-plus-plus/"><em>Effective C++</em></a>, a book which not only teaches good C++ practices and principles, but also explains what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes to make those efforts so effectual. <a href="http://amzn.to/29dU9FO"><em>Effective Modern C++</em></a> is the same book aimed at a different audience. The audience of <em>Effective C++</em> was the developer who could use C++ to build a humble home of straw or wood, but didn&rsquo;t know that C++ was born to create homes of brick and mortar. <em>Effective Modern C++</em> is for the seasoned developer who knows the brick home they built with C++98 can stand tall, but is bewildered by the plethora of modern amenities available in the top-floor penthouse that is C++11.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>Even when first introduced to the language, it seemed the mentality around C++ was that it was simple, baremetal, and robust. It didn&rsquo;t need garbage collection. It didn&rsquo;t need decent threading (fork that). Lambdas? Type deduction? Go talk to a language specification who cares!</p>

<p>But here we are. C++11 can now act a little bit more like its cousins C# and Java, but run fast like its pappy C. I have been on a number of projects where C++11 is king for the last 3 months. The last time I had been on a C++ project, we seemed to be stuck in the ice age. As I first started reading this book, I would read one of the items and apply it directly to the code I was working on literally the following morning. This new C++ is downright <em>luxurious</em> compared to the old one.</p>

<p>C++11 gives us the <code>auto</code> pointer for type deduction, similar to <code>var</code> in C#. Some examples:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Thing</span><span class="p">();</span>       <span class="c1">// y is Thing*</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>C++11 also has new loop syntax for iterators:</p>

<p>You may notice in the above code the use of curly braces to initalize the std::vector. Braced initialization allows us to use a <code>std::initalizer_list</code> to initalize STL objects, but it also allows basic construction.</p>

<p>There are now lambdas: function handles defined dynamically which can capture other variables (called a closure).</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above example, x is captured by reference. You could also copy-capture x by excluding the <code>&amp;</code>.</p>

<p>You like garbage collection? We got you covered. There&rsquo;s <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to represent one-shot memory that should be deleted when the pointer goes out of scope, and there&rsquo;s <code>std::shared_ptr</code> which is reference counted and will be deleted when all references to the shared_ptr go out of scope. These language enhancements are essential, and anyone well-versed in the usage of <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code> and <code>boost::shared_ptr</code> will have no trouble getting the hang of these.</p>

<p>The concurrency API is pretty neat, though I haven&rsquo;t had much chance to play with it. <code>std::atomic</code> allows you to create objects which are guaranteed to be read/write thread-safely. <code>std::future</code> allows you to fire off a command in another thread and continue after it&rsquo;s completion.</p>

<p>Looking to override a method? You can indicate an intentional override with the <code>override</code> keyword to tell the reader and the compiler you&rsquo;re intending to override a parent method. Comes in handy.</p>

<p>Another nice construct is <code>nullptr</code>. In C++, <code>NULL</code> is actually just 0. Because of this you might even see your fellow developers comparing pointers to 0 while you try to determine their intent. We can now compare and set our NULL pointers to <code>nullptr</code>: an improvement soft in functionality, but noticeable in readability.</p>

<p>Although I loved reading about C++ in bite-sized chunks throughout this book, there were a few things that went over my head (not just the first time). A major point of friction between myself and the author were universal references (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) and the <code>move</code> operator. These concepts were new to me and difficult to grasp the first few times they were brought up in this book. It may have been the order they were presented, or it may have been my lack of contact with them in the real world, but I would recommend having some level of understanding for universal references before reading those parts of this book.</p>

<p>The <code>move</code> operation moves the contents of memory from one object into another, as opposed to a copy operation which will duplicate that memory. A universal reference is, in some sense, a way to allow either a <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> to be called based on whether an lvalue or an rvalue is being passed in. There are lots of rules involved, and sometimes <code>move</code> is faster than <code>copy</code> but other times it isn&rsquo;t. For me (and I assume many others), this confusion will lead me to largely ignore this feature for now.</p>

<p>There is also quite a bit of discussion early in the book about using type deduction in templates with <code>auto</code> and <code>decltype</code>, but this discussion made my head hurt and made me glad I don&rsquo;t do much template metaprogramming.</p>

<p>On top of all this goodness (and more I didn&rsquo;t mention), C++14 includes a lot of bonus features that make C++ even a little sweeter. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14">shortlist</a>. (Looking for a list of C++11 features? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">Here you go</a>.)</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html">Thomas Becker&rsquo;s overview of universal references</a></li>
<li>Buy the <em>Effective</em> books missing from my collection</li>
<li>Keep coding with C++</li>
<li>Enable C++14 in a project</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you weren&rsquo;t paying close attention, you may not have noticed that Github has recently <a href="https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile">removed Streaks from profile pages</a> along with a few other changes.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Github tracked each user&rsquo;s commit history every day and displayed this information prominently on the user&rsquo;s profile for the past 365 days. When committing multiple days in succession, a &ldquo;streak&rdquo; is started. Your streak resets the next solar day you don&rsquo;t commit to Github.</p>

<p><strong>What was the purpose of the streak?</strong></p>

<p>The streak encouraged developers to contribute public open-source code as frequently as possible. This is a very good thing! Maybe it even influenced some people to contribute to open-source projects that desperately needed help. Maybe it helped some developers explore new codebases and languages they never dreamt of exploring previously.</p>

<p>However, any good feelings that came from the streak are instantly dashed when you take a day off. All those good-feels you get after working hard to get a 10-day streak? Crushed in an instant. Now you need to start over, but you don&rsquo;t bother because every time you feel a streak coming on it&rsquo;s dashed away. This is a painful reminder that life is short, and you&rsquo;ll only be rewarded in the short-term for any effort you put in.</p>

<p><strong>So if the good-feels wasn&rsquo;t the purpose, how about notoriety? Surely someone with a long streak is a good person and a noble developer!</strong></p>

<p>Except for <a href="https://gist.github.com/cirosantilli/4d24fc646ab9aec8def7">gists like this</a> which will help you generate a 100-year streak. Or the fact that you could make empty commits to personal repos and manipulate the streak. Or you could be making minor documentation/newline changes every day. Not only that, but not all developers use Github as their primary source control platform. Developers could be making contributions to Bitbucket as well as Github and not have that reflected in their streak at all.</p>

<p><strong>My theory is that streaks, though well-intended, served no purpose.</strong></p>

<p>They were ripe for abuse and not a very good &ldquo;reward&rdquo; for contributing code on the side, nor a good indicator of how grey a developer&rsquo;s beard is. Not all good developers make commits every day, and encouraging a commit-a-day is getting people trapped in the Silicon Valley bad-habit of never not working. For the time being, good riddance.</p>

<p>At Canonical, we use Launchpad to host most of our source code. Launchpad has this concept of &ldquo;Karma&rdquo; which tracks your commits, code reviews, bug reports, branch merges, etc on Launchpad. Karma decays over time but not immediately, which means that you can take days off and maintain Karma. From this number, you can usually tell if a user is new to the system, highly active recently, or has turned into a manager. For reference, mine is <a href="https://launchpad.net/~larryprice/+karma">a little over 3000</a> as of this blog post. Although I mostly like the way Karma works, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the epitome of source code gamification.</p>

<p>As far as I know, sites like Bitbucket and GitLab don&rsquo;t have such a concept of rewarding heavy coders or giving some indication of recent activity outside of a news feed. Maybe a news feed style is enough?</p>

<p>The good people at Github want you to code socially, and I&rsquo;m excited to see if they can come up with a fun and light way to gamify open-source software while avoiding some of the unfun aspects of streaks and the blaisé concept of news feeds.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you miss streaks? Did streaks motivate you to contribute more frequently? Any ideas for a new system? Tell me in the comments!</p>
