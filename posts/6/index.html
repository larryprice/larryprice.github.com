  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Have you ever seen a six-month-old or a three-year-old who’s not curious and self-directed? I haven’t. That’s how we are out of the box.<br/>
&ndash; Dan Pink</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Gist</h3>

<p>Daniel Pink&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/1SZTo29"><em>Drive</em></a> explores how to motivate modern humans. Today&rsquo;s offices still employ business practices created to meet the needs of late 19th and early 20th century workers performing monotonous tasks, but many modern workers spend their days doing creative work which is ill-suited for stick-and-carrot management. Pink posits that today&rsquo;s workforce crave autonomy, mastery, and purpose to lead a satisfying life and produce better, maybe even faster, results.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Stick and carrot&rdquo; refers to the technique of &ldquo;if you do this, then you&rsquo;ll get that&rdquo; motivation. Work overtime this week and I&rsquo;ll buy you bagels on Friday. Read a book and you&rsquo;ll get a free personal pan pizza. Sit, good boy, here&rsquo;s a treat. Alternatively, &ldquo;now that&rdquo; rewards are ok from time to time. &ldquo;Now that&rdquo; the team has worked well together for a few weeks, I decided to bring in some donuts. &ldquo;Now that&rdquo; we handed off the code to the client, let&rsquo;s go get lunch. Note that &ldquo;now that&rdquo; rewards should not become predictable, lest they become &ldquo;if then&rdquo; rewards.</p>

<p>The concepts in this book are not new. Researchers have discovered this kind of interesting behavior since the &lsquo;60s, and each time they are essentially ignored by the general population. Over the last few years, I have read several books on this topic and assumed we were only just starting to realize that sticks and carrots were bad for creative work, but it seems to have taken some time for these concepts to enter the public view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flow&rdquo; is the optimal state of working, where the work is challenging enough to keep one engaged but familiar enough to allow mental connections to be made. It doesn&rsquo;t mean working on something so easy one can get it done fast, because such trivial exercises are boring and non-enriching. Alternatively, it doesn&rsquo;t mean working on something so difficult that one is &ldquo;head down&rdquo; for several days accomplishing nothing, because this type of task is exhausting. You&rsquo;ll know when flow has struck when you glance up at the clock and suddenly an hour has gone by and you feel good about what you&rsquo;ve already accomplished and you can see what you&rsquo;ll be accomplishing in the next hour.</p>

<p>Although money is a poor way to motivate workers, all workers should still be given a fair base pay and benefits package. Everyone needs to live, and unfortunately we don&rsquo;t live in a Roddenberry socialist utopia where everyone works together to build a functioning world where everyone is paid in the love of one&rsquo;s career. In fact, Pink prescribes that organizations should try to pay employees slightly above average, which should essentially take the money issue off the table during recruiting and retention.</p>

<p>The best motivation in the modern workplace is the encouragement of <em>autonomy</em>, <em>mastery</em>, and <em>purpose</em>.</p>

<p><em>Autonomy</em> is the ability to make decisions for oneself, and cause a meaningful impact on the work being done. The craving of the modern human for autonomy can be explicitly seen in the rise of agile software development, remote working, Etsy retailers, startups, farmer&rsquo;s markets, and freelancing over the past 20 years. When people are allowed to make decisions without the intervention of big brother, they feel more ownership over the work they do, and they feel more freedom to be creative.</p>

<p><em>Mastery</em> is continual improvement. A 5K runner achieves her goal of finishing in 20 minutes and sets a new goal for 19 minutes, then 18 minutes, and so on. She never stops to say &ldquo;20 minutes was good enough, I think I&rsquo;ll stop now.&rdquo; Mastery is usually something that can never 100% achieved, but the quest for mastery is something that drives us to be better than  we were yesterday.</p>

<p>When we think about <em>purpose</em>, we think about leaving our mark on the world. For some organizations, this may involve redistributing part (or all) of the annual revenue to charity. It could also mean building a better medical device for diabetics. Not all purposes are created equal. Improved quarterly sales, more working hours, higher profit margins, happier stockholders are all invalid purposes that do not drive workers to be happier.</p>

<p>Schools suffer substantially from our system of numbers-based achievements. Better grades and better test results have become the primary indicator of success, quelling the curiosity of our children and destroying the happiness of our teachers. Getting away from numbers-based learning will be an extremely difficult task, but there are already schools working towards this goal.</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Recognize when I&rsquo;ve been in flow and write it down.</li>
<li>Recognize when someone is offering me an &ldquo;if-then&rdquo; reward, and try to determine a better way to think about it.</li>
<li>Recognize when I offer someone an &ldquo;if-then&rdquo;, and think about the consequences. Did they perform better or worse than I expected? How could I have created an opportunity for the other person to improve themselves instead?</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another year gone.</p>

<h3>What I Wanted from 2015</h3>

<p>I set some arbitrary goals for myself at the end of 2014, and I sort of accomplished most of them. Here&rsquo;s a short list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contribute meaningful code to several open source projects not created by me

<ul>
<li>Documentation to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/ace">ace</a>, features to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/asknot">asknot</a>, minor fix to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/fireplace">fireplace</a>, minor fix to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/indyhackers.org-planet">planet.indyhackers</a>, small feature to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gvp">gvp</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read at least 1 book per month

<ul>
<li>I read 8 books professionally, started getting into graphic novels, and read a couple of silly books by celebrities. I&rsquo;ll count this as a win.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attend more meetups

<ul>
<li>I hosted quite a few Golang meetups and attended a few ISA meetups, but I&rsquo;m not sure I actually went to more meetups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&gt;3000 sessions/month on this blog (currently ~1400)

<ul>
<li>By the end of the year, I was doing a little over 4000 sessions/month. I had a few popular posts on Go and Docker which I believe contributed to this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve social skills

<ul>
<li>Eh. Unfortunately, this year I largely worked on solo projects in the office which didn&rsquo;t give me many opportunities to improve my social skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work remotely more and better

<ul>
<li>I started off the year doing this well and I was working 2 days a week from home. After one of my projects got canceled, I never managed to get back into the swing of working remotely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obtain more technical leadership roles on projects

<ul>
<li>Technically, I accomplished this. Again, this feels like somewhat of a weak victory as I only had the opportunities to lead myself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Surprise Victories of 2015</h3>

<p>Not everything can be planned.</p>

<ul>
<li>Got paid to build a video course on <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/go-web-development-video">writing web applications in Go</a>.

<ul>
<li>I was approached via email by Packt Publishing after they recognized all of my work on my blog and Github in Go. I agreed to create a multi-video course on creating a modern web application in Go from scratch. This was a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. Since I love to teach, I may be looking for more opportunities like this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SEP Professional Development Revamp

<ul>
<li>I am a part of a continued effort to overhaul the Professional Development system at SEP. We are moving away from monetary rewards and towards shared experiences. The first iteration received positive feedback, and we are days away from launching our second attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guides Program

<ul>
<li>In late October, I was asked to be a &ldquo;guide&rdquo; for a new employee at SEP. I jumped at the opportunity and have been lucky to help guide an all-around good guy through his first few months at SEP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Sourcing <a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>

<ul>
<li>We even got a few pull requests. See <a href="https://github.com/sep/ollert">the repo</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cats

<ul>
<li>We got two cats, Juniper and Jelly Bean. I didn&rsquo;t even know I wanted cats until I got them, but they&rsquo;ve been an important addition to my little family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Things I Worked On Professionally</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this brief.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reporting tool for school administrators in Go</li>
<li>Critical web bugs in a traffic radar system, primarily Javascript work</li>
<li>iOS app for sending results from a medical device to client servers</li>
<li>Bugs and minor features for previous client building an e-commerce website in C# ASP.NET both WebForms and MVC</li>
</ul>


<h3>What I Want From 2016</h3>

<ul>
<li>Spend Money

<ul>
<li>My parents raised me to be cheap, and we always seemed to be just scraping by. These teachings served me very well in college and for the year or two after, but now I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have a great job, house, wife, American dream, etc, and I&rsquo;ve found myself becoming somewhat of a miser. We finally bit the bullet this weekend and bought a fancy new mattress, but I want this to be the year of me buying new stuff that I&rsquo;ve always wanted but been too hesitant to purchase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Back Into Web

<ul>
<li>I got really deep into web in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and it&rsquo;s a platform that I really like to work in. If I can&rsquo;t find web work in the office, I&rsquo;ll be making open-source web work a priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work With Others

<ul>
<li>This has been the year of solo projects for me, and to be quite honest I&rsquo;ve found myself feeling downright lonely the past couple months. It&rsquo;s frustrating to have no one to share with, to fight with, and to laugh with on a project. I intend to rail hard against any project assignment where I am the only engineer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Become Part of an Open-Source Community

<ul>
<li>I have a tendency to build my own side-projects or submit individual pull requests and never be heard from again. This year, I want to find a project where I can be a part of something bigger than just me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Vibes

<ul>
<li>I want to have a positive influence. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure how people view me now, but I understand that I complain a lot and probably come off as a bit negative. I know that I have the power to make waves when given the chance, but I want to make sure that those waves don&rsquo;t leave the surfers with a sour taste in their mouths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>So Long, 2015</h3>

<p>A year where I didn&rsquo;t accomplish as much of what I set out to, but I managed to find a few surprise wins along the way. If you catch me going against any of my resolutions in 2016, I encourage you to deride me and set me back on track; I&rsquo;ll be happy to do the same for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have published a video series on building web applications in Go called <em><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/go-web-development-video">Go for Web Development</a></em>.</p>

<p>These videos will guide you through the entire process of creating a web application in Go, all the way from spinning up a basic web server to multi-user authentication. In the end, you&rsquo;ll learn how to vendor dependencies and deploy the application to heroku. Throughout the course, you&rsquo;ll learn to utilize many of the most popular go packages including gorilla/mux, negroni, gorp, ace, and bcrypt. You&rsquo;ll learn about making asynchronous requests from the browser back to the web server, and you&rsquo;ll learn to access external REST APIs from your web server. You&rsquo;ll use go&rsquo;s struct tags to parse both XML and JSON, and you&rsquo;ll use struct tags to access database entities with gorp.</p>

<p>I spent many late nights creating this course, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of lessons about creating screencasts along the way. I was also able to solidify much of my base understanding of the go language and learn about many features I don&rsquo;t often utilize. The videos are published by Packt Publishing, and they were a great help along the way. The most valuable lesson I learned from doing these screencasts is that a quality microphone makes a huge difference, and I would have saved myself a lot of trouble had I used my Rock Band microphone from the beginning. In the end everything turned out great. I&rsquo;m relieved to be finished and excited to have an official ISBN connected to my name.</p>

<p><s>The video is currently only $5 for the holidays, but</s> the regular retail price is set to $75 (which is still a bargain considering all the content).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Gist</h3>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1OVjj3Z">Javascript: The Good Parts</a> by Douglas Crockford is a short guide to the best parts of the javascript language. Javascript is notorious for being so flexible and feature-rich that many traditional programmers start writing code and completely forget how to program and building a startup based on an idea they got from the <a href="https://twitter.com/boredelonmusk">Bored Elon Musk</a> mock-Twitter account only to wake up a year later cold and alone living in the slums of San Francisco. This book is full of example code with thoughtful explanations to help the average developer write better javascript and leave the web a nicer place.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>I read this book because I thought the title was too snarky for its own good. Javascript is flexible and capable of doing nearly anything you need but, like any tool, can easily be misused by newcomers. Since javascript is the de facto language of the web, many developers who use javascript are novices or don&rsquo;t think they need to know the language constructs because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a real language.&rdquo; Unfortunately, this results in a lot of spaghetti code and insecure javascript being processed by our web browsers.</p>

<p>I studied javascript this past fall to try to hone my skills, and I found that many of the little tricks I picked up through independent study had already been collected in this book. Anyone doing javascript should have a passing knowledge of the contents of this book before they are allowed to push to production.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll get off my soapbox and point out a few of my favorite points made in this book.</p>

<p>Javascripts most powerful structures are <code>Object</code> and <code>Array</code>. An <code>Array</code> is an <code>Object</code> with properties of type <code>Number</code> cast to integers in sequential order. This means that the <code>Array</code> object <code>[0, 1, "mario", "luigi"]</code> is represented as an <code>Object</code> as <code>{"0": 0, "1": 1, "2": "mario", "3": "luigi"}</code>.</p>

<p><code>Object.hasOwnProperty</code> tells you whether the given property name is on the object&rsquo;s prototype or has been defined on the current object. This is very useful when using a <code>for in</code> loop to filter properties on an object.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;ve frequently used the module pattern with a self-executing function to create private scope, I hadn&rsquo;t connected the dots that the reason this magic works is because of closures. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><code>MyModule</code> contains the private variable <code>x</code>, which cannot be accessed by anyone who has a reference to this function. However, the internal functions <code>reset</code> and <code>do</code> do have access to the private variable. Because of this, we know no external code can manipulate our internal value and we can guarantee some amount of consistency in our code given there was no tampering of the source. Of course, closures are useful for far more than just scoping variables.</p>

<p>Although there are many ways to mimic traditional inheritance in javascript with <code>new</code> and defining the <code>constructor</code> method on a prototype, it usually makes more sense to use <em>differential inheritance</em>. Given an object named <code>bird</code>, we&rsquo;ll make a new object named <code>parrot</code> using <code>var parrot = Object.create(bird);</code> and start setting new properties on <code>parrot</code> This type of inheritance uses the basics of the language to our advantage and adheres nicely to the native prototypal constructs.</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Differential inheritance.</strong> I&rsquo;ve always tried to force traditional inheritance into my javascript architecture, and it&rsquo;s always felt wrong. The next time I need inheritance, I will try to use DI to utilize javascript&rsquo;s prototype system better.</li>
<li><strong>Write more javascript.</strong> It&rsquo;s been a while since I got to write javascript professionally, so I&rsquo;d like to ensure I maintain my knowledge base over the coming months by writing more javascript on the side. As web programming is where I want to be, hopefully I can get back into building for the web before the end of the year.</li>
