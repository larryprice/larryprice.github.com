  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend was the 2016 SEP Startup Weekend, a bi-annual hackathon where a few of the engineers get together for 48 hours to build things. As far as most people know, we transform massive quantities of beer, coffee, and unhealthy food into cohesive piles of code. Although that about sums it up, I thought it might be nice to chronicle my team&rsquo;s experience of this season&rsquo;s event. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>The Pitch</h3>

<p>In my first startup weekend since <a href="/blog/2014/07/13/ollert-reveal-the-data-behind-your-trello-boards/">Ollert</a>, I pitched an idea for an instant runoff voting platform called RePoll. RePoll would allow users to create polls, rank candidates, and view results in a login-less system via a web portal, Android, and iOS app. To make it all interesting, I wanted to do all of the coding in javascript by using <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for the web frontend and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> for the iOS and Android apps.</p>

<h3>Friday</h3>

<p>I somehow convinced 3 of my coworkers to help me on Friday night, who I&rsquo;ll refer to as H, G, and K, forming teams by combining the letters.</p>

<p>After sending around a few images and documents with my proposed architecture, I had GH start working together to build the Android app in React Native. Unfortunately, we hit a few snags in getting React Native to run an Android app on actual hardware, but late into the evening everything was up and running on a <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/">genymotion simulator</a>. By the end of the night, GH had a good portion of the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html#content">React Native opening tutorial</a> completed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, K and myself were hard at work building a core web API in NodeJS for all apps to use. We decided to use Mongo so we didn&rsquo;t have to worry about updating schema and initializing databases, and we used <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> to test our API calls. I may have overarchitected the session/token-based authorization system, but we got over 50% of the way done with the API. In my initial estimates, I wanted to have the API 100% completed by Friday night, but we were all tired and decided to break for the night around 10p.</p>

<p>Although everyone else headed out the door, the garage was packed with cars leaving a fancy-pants event held near our office. I stayed behind for about an hour setting up our API to run on <a href="https://re-poll.herokuapp.com/">heroku with a MongoDB instance</a>, and then configuring DNS for the domain I had already purchased.</p>

<h3>Saturday</h3>

<p>I arrived early and laid down <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0XxLqWttW6u6vP3Yz9Sye3">some sweet jams</a>. I continued working on the API alone and had K start working on the iOS app. We added a new teammate, dubbed A, who started work on the web frontend. The API neared completion by the end of the afternoon, and the mobile apps were beginning to hook into the publicly accessible API. During this time, several bugs were found in the initial API code and were fixed. The iOS app was making quick UI progress, but having issues connecting to the API. I started floating between dev teams as I got drowsy, but eventually got a second wind and started helping with the web frontend. The Android and web applications were both able to create polls before everyone went home. A started using a web React datetime component to set start and end dates, while the Android team was figuring out how to use the native calendar and clock to select dates and times.</p>

<p>To store data, the mobile teams started using the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html">Async Storage</a> library which allows for OS-agnostic storage of data in iOS and Android. On the web frontend, we used local storage to keep around any information we might need.</p>

<p>Near the end of the night as I started working on the poll results page on the web frontend, I started finding system-crashing bugs in my interpretation of instant runoff voting, and eventually found that the results weren&rsquo;t always correct.</p>

<p>One item slowing us down Saturday when writing React Native code was its insistence on using syntax defined in ES2015. Our team was largely unfamiliar with this new syntax, so this tripped us up a bit more than expected. All in all, it was a great learning experience to see this cutting edge specification in action.</p>

<h3>Sunday</h3>

<p>Early again, I created a <a href="https://repoll-web.herokuapp.com/">heroku app for our web frontend</a> and set up the DNS appropriately. As the rest of the team started to pile in (and the smells of bacon arose from the Commons), I transitioned to trying to fix the incorrect ballot-counting logic in the API. I ended up rewriting the code several times, but finally found an algorithm that worked correctly. At this point I was kicking myself for not writing tests to verify we were writing good code.</p>

<p>The Android team caught a second wind, finishing the create poll page and started tackling poll lookup. The original plans called for a typeahead, which ended up being tougher to implement than expected, so the Android app instead supplied a simple textbox to attempt to match an existing poll. In doing this, the Android team successfully created an authentication token in the API and was able to display poll candidates in the app before running out of time.</p>

<p>The iOS team continued to have issues with the API, but successfully mocked out most of the rest of the app right before the demos.</p>

<p>Due to familiarity with the tech, the web team was able to get most of the way to a completed layout. I hastily fashioned a dual-list system for seeing candidates and ballot selection, while A transformed that system into a drag and droppable component. We were able to submit updated ballots to the server and fetch previous ballots for our poll tokens. With the updated API, the results page started working and it became possible to view the steps involved in eliminating candidates during the runoff process.</p>

<p>During demos, we presented all three apps and everyone was quite impressed at our javascripting.</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>General Things</em>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn more about React Native.</strong> I was largely shielded from the pain as I was working on the API and React web parts of our project, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen and heard React Native is an incredible framework for getting things done and sharing code and code paradigms.</li>
<li><strong>Start using ES2015.</strong> Tools like <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> allow us to start using next-generation javascript standards to write code now even if the browser support is unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>Do more with <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> or <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a>.</strong> I want to be able to use these tools to optimize pre-rendering on our site, but we were in such a rush we primarily used webpack to enable us to use several NodeJS dependencies. Still cool, but there&rsquo;s so much else to explore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Startup Weekend</em>

<ul>
<li><strong>Estimate better.</strong> I drastically underestimated the amount of work needed to get this project completed in a weekend. We would have had a better chance had I pre-built the API. I think doing some pre-work in this case would have been okay, but I also could have asked for more help. Next time I would like to do a better job of figuring out how much work there is and how much time it will take.</li>
<li><strong>Be an expert.</strong> About half the work we did this weekend was in unknown territory for me. I should have studied further on getting React Native working before the event, and I should have known a little bit more about ES2015 as well. Although the lack of expertise slowed us down a bit, my teammates were extremely adaptive and loved learning the new tech.</li>
<li><strong>Create and prep the team beforehand.</strong> I had enlisted one engineer before the pitches Friday night, and I ran my presentation through that engineer to verify it all made sense. I should have also run some of my architecture ideas past that engineer to get buy-in. I also wouldn&rsquo;t mind having the team mostly formed before we start, but that&rsquo;s a big commitment to ask of people.</li>
<li><strong>Take more frequent, shorter breaks.</strong> We hit the Monon Saturday afternoon and walked for 30-40 minutes which ended up making me drowsy. However, the fresh air did us some good and was revitalizing for the project in general. It would be great to have more frequent, 10-15 minute walks, but it&rsquo;s really difficult to find a time when the team is ready to take a group break in such a fast-paced environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Have you ever seen a six-month-old or a three-year-old who’s not curious and self-directed? I haven’t. That’s how we are out of the box.<br/>
&ndash; Dan Pink</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Gist</h3>

<p>Daniel Pink&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/1SZTo29"><em>Drive</em></a> explores how to motivate modern humans. Today&rsquo;s offices still employ business practices created to meet the needs of late 19th and early 20th century workers performing monotonous tasks, but many modern workers spend their days doing creative work which is ill-suited for stick-and-carrot management. Pink posits that today&rsquo;s workforce crave autonomy, mastery, and purpose to lead a satisfying life and produce better, maybe even faster, results.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Stick and carrot&rdquo; refers to the technique of &ldquo;if you do this, then you&rsquo;ll get that&rdquo; motivation. Work overtime this week and I&rsquo;ll buy you bagels on Friday. Read a book and you&rsquo;ll get a free personal pan pizza. Sit, good boy, here&rsquo;s a treat. Alternatively, &ldquo;now that&rdquo; rewards are ok from time to time. &ldquo;Now that&rdquo; the team has worked well together for a few weeks, I decided to bring in some donuts. &ldquo;Now that&rdquo; we handed off the code to the client, let&rsquo;s go get lunch. Note that &ldquo;now that&rdquo; rewards should not become predictable, lest they become &ldquo;if then&rdquo; rewards.</p>

<p>The concepts in this book are not new. Researchers have discovered this kind of interesting behavior since the &lsquo;60s, and each time they are essentially ignored by the general population. Over the last few years, I have read several books on this topic and assumed we were only just starting to realize that sticks and carrots were bad for creative work, but it seems to have taken some time for these concepts to enter the public view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flow&rdquo; is the optimal state of working, where the work is challenging enough to keep one engaged but familiar enough to allow mental connections to be made. It doesn&rsquo;t mean working on something so easy one can get it done fast, because such trivial exercises are boring and non-enriching. Alternatively, it doesn&rsquo;t mean working on something so difficult that one is &ldquo;head down&rdquo; for several days accomplishing nothing, because this type of task is exhausting. You&rsquo;ll know when flow has struck when you glance up at the clock and suddenly an hour has gone by and you feel good about what you&rsquo;ve already accomplished and you can see what you&rsquo;ll be accomplishing in the next hour.</p>

<p>Although money is a poor way to motivate workers, all workers should still be given a fair base pay and benefits package. Everyone needs to live, and unfortunately we don&rsquo;t live in a Roddenberry socialist utopia where everyone works together to build a functioning world where everyone is paid in the love of one&rsquo;s career. In fact, Pink prescribes that organizations should try to pay employees slightly above average, which should essentially take the money issue off the table during recruiting and retention.</p>

<p>The best motivation in the modern workplace is the encouragement of <em>autonomy</em>, <em>mastery</em>, and <em>purpose</em>.</p>

<p><em>Autonomy</em> is the ability to make decisions for oneself, and cause a meaningful impact on the work being done. The craving of the modern human for autonomy can be explicitly seen in the rise of agile software development, remote working, Etsy retailers, startups, farmer&rsquo;s markets, and freelancing over the past 20 years. When people are allowed to make decisions without the intervention of big brother, they feel more ownership over the work they do, and they feel more freedom to be creative.</p>

<p><em>Mastery</em> is continual improvement. A 5K runner achieves her goal of finishing in 20 minutes and sets a new goal for 19 minutes, then 18 minutes, and so on. She never stops to say &ldquo;20 minutes was good enough, I think I&rsquo;ll stop now.&rdquo; Mastery is usually something that can never 100% achieved, but the quest for mastery is something that drives us to be better than  we were yesterday.</p>

<p>When we think about <em>purpose</em>, we think about leaving our mark on the world. For some organizations, this may involve redistributing part (or all) of the annual revenue to charity. It could also mean building a better medical device for diabetics. Not all purposes are created equal. Improved quarterly sales, more working hours, higher profit margins, happier stockholders are all invalid purposes that do not drive workers to be happier.</p>

<p>Schools suffer substantially from our system of numbers-based achievements. Better grades and better test results have become the primary indicator of success, quelling the curiosity of our children and destroying the happiness of our teachers. Getting away from numbers-based learning will be an extremely difficult task, but there are already schools working towards this goal.</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Recognize when I&rsquo;ve been in flow and write it down.</li>
<li>Recognize when someone is offering me an &ldquo;if-then&rdquo; reward, and try to determine a better way to think about it.</li>
<li>Recognize when I offer someone an &ldquo;if-then&rdquo;, and think about the consequences. Did they perform better or worse than I expected? How could I have created an opportunity for the other person to improve themselves instead?</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another year gone.</p>

<h3>What I Wanted from 2015</h3>

<p>I set some arbitrary goals for myself at the end of 2014, and I sort of accomplished most of them. Here&rsquo;s a short list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contribute meaningful code to several open source projects not created by me

<ul>
<li>Documentation to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/ace">ace</a>, features to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/asknot">asknot</a>, minor fix to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/fireplace">fireplace</a>, minor fix to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/indyhackers.org-planet">planet.indyhackers</a>, small feature to <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/gvp">gvp</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read at least 1 book per month

<ul>
<li>I read 8 books professionally, started getting into graphic novels, and read a couple of silly books by celebrities. I&rsquo;ll count this as a win.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attend more meetups

<ul>
<li>I hosted quite a few Golang meetups and attended a few ISA meetups, but I&rsquo;m not sure I actually went to more meetups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&gt;3000 sessions/month on this blog (currently ~1400)

<ul>
<li>By the end of the year, I was doing a little over 4000 sessions/month. I had a few popular posts on Go and Docker which I believe contributed to this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improve social skills

<ul>
<li>Eh. Unfortunately, this year I largely worked on solo projects in the office which didn&rsquo;t give me many opportunities to improve my social skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work remotely more and better

<ul>
<li>I started off the year doing this well and I was working 2 days a week from home. After one of my projects got canceled, I never managed to get back into the swing of working remotely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obtain more technical leadership roles on projects

<ul>
<li>Technically, I accomplished this. Again, this feels like somewhat of a weak victory as I only had the opportunities to lead myself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Surprise Victories of 2015</h3>

<p>Not everything can be planned.</p>

<ul>
<li>Got paid to build a video course on <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/go-web-development-video">writing web applications in Go</a>.

<ul>
<li>I was approached via email by Packt Publishing after they recognized all of my work on my blog and Github in Go. I agreed to create a multi-video course on creating a modern web application in Go from scratch. This was a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. Since I love to teach, I may be looking for more opportunities like this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SEP Professional Development Revamp

<ul>
<li>I am a part of a continued effort to overhaul the Professional Development system at SEP. We are moving away from monetary rewards and towards shared experiences. The first iteration received positive feedback, and we are days away from launching our second attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guides Program

<ul>
<li>In late October, I was asked to be a &ldquo;guide&rdquo; for a new employee at SEP. I jumped at the opportunity and have been lucky to help guide an all-around good guy through his first few months at SEP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Sourcing <a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>

<ul>
<li>We even got a few pull requests. See <a href="https://github.com/sep/ollert">the repo</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cats

<ul>
<li>We got two cats, Juniper and Jelly Bean. I didn&rsquo;t even know I wanted cats until I got them, but they&rsquo;ve been an important addition to my little family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Things I Worked On Professionally</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this brief.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reporting tool for school administrators in Go</li>
<li>Critical web bugs in a traffic radar system, primarily Javascript work</li>
<li>iOS app for sending results from a medical device to client servers</li>
<li>Bugs and minor features for previous client building an e-commerce website in C# ASP.NET both WebForms and MVC</li>
</ul>


<h3>What I Want From 2016</h3>

<ul>
<li>Spend Money

<ul>
<li>My parents raised me to be cheap, and we always seemed to be just scraping by. These teachings served me very well in college and for the year or two after, but now I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have a great job, house, wife, American dream, etc, and I&rsquo;ve found myself becoming somewhat of a miser. We finally bit the bullet this weekend and bought a fancy new mattress, but I want this to be the year of me buying new stuff that I&rsquo;ve always wanted but been too hesitant to purchase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Back Into Web

<ul>
<li>I got really deep into web in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and it&rsquo;s a platform that I really like to work in. If I can&rsquo;t find web work in the office, I&rsquo;ll be making open-source web work a priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work With Others

<ul>
<li>This has been the year of solo projects for me, and to be quite honest I&rsquo;ve found myself feeling downright lonely the past couple months. It&rsquo;s frustrating to have no one to share with, to fight with, and to laugh with on a project. I intend to rail hard against any project assignment where I am the only engineer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Become Part of an Open-Source Community

<ul>
<li>I have a tendency to build my own side-projects or submit individual pull requests and never be heard from again. This year, I want to find a project where I can be a part of something bigger than just me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Vibes

<ul>
<li>I want to have a positive influence. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure how people view me now, but I understand that I complain a lot and probably come off as a bit negative. I know that I have the power to make waves when given the chance, but I want to make sure that those waves don&rsquo;t leave the surfers with a sour taste in their mouths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>So Long, 2015</h3>

<p>A year where I didn&rsquo;t accomplish as much of what I set out to, but I managed to find a few surprise wins along the way. If you catch me going against any of my resolutions in 2016, I encourage you to deride me and set me back on track; I&rsquo;ll be happy to do the same for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have published a video series on building web applications in Go called <em><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/go-web-development-video">Go for Web Development</a></em>.</p>

<p>These videos will guide you through the entire process of creating a web application in Go, all the way from spinning up a basic web server to multi-user authentication. In the end, you&rsquo;ll learn how to vendor dependencies and deploy the application to heroku. Throughout the course, you&rsquo;ll learn to utilize many of the most popular go packages including gorilla/mux, negroni, gorp, ace, and bcrypt. You&rsquo;ll learn about making asynchronous requests from the browser back to the web server, and you&rsquo;ll learn to access external REST APIs from your web server. You&rsquo;ll use go&rsquo;s struct tags to parse both XML and JSON, and you&rsquo;ll use struct tags to access database entities with gorp.</p>

<p>I spent many late nights creating this course, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of lessons about creating screencasts along the way. I was also able to solidify much of my base understanding of the go language and learn about many features I don&rsquo;t often utilize. The videos are published by Packt Publishing, and they were a great help along the way. The most valuable lesson I learned from doing these screencasts is that a quality microphone makes a huge difference, and I would have saved myself a lot of trouble had I used my Rock Band microphone from the beginning. In the end everything turned out great. I&rsquo;m relieved to be finished and excited to have an official ISBN connected to my name.</p>

<p><s>The video is currently only $5 for the holidays, but</s> the regular retail price is set to $75 (which is still a bargain considering all the content).</p>
