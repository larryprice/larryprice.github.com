  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Gist</h3>

<p>How can one man give the world so much? Scott Meyers transformed my understanding of C++ with <a href="/blog/2013/07/16/effective-c-plus-plus/"><em>Effective C++</em></a>, a book which not only teaches good C++ practices and principles, but also explains what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes to make those efforts so effectual. <a href="http://amzn.to/29dU9FO"><em>Effective Modern C++</em></a> is the same book aimed at a different audience. The audience of <em>Effective C++</em> was the developer who could use C++ to build a humble home of straw or wood, but didn&rsquo;t know that C++ was born to create homes of brick and mortar. <em>Effective Modern C++</em> is for the seasoned developer who knows the brick home they built with C++98 can stand tall, but is bewildered by the plethora of modern amenities available in the top-floor penthouse that is C++11.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>Even when first introduced to the language, it seemed the mentality around C++ was that it was simple, baremetal, and robust. It didn&rsquo;t need garbage collection. It didn&rsquo;t need decent threading (fork that). Lambdas? Type deduction? Go talk to a language specification who cares!</p>

<p>But here we are. C++11 can now act a little bit more like its cousins C# and Java, but run fast like its pappy C. I have been on a number of projects where C++11 is king for the last 3 months. The last time I had been on a C++ project, we seemed to be stuck in the ice age. As I first started reading this book, I would read one of the items and apply it directly to the code I was working on literally the following morning. This new C++ is downright <em>luxurious</em> compared to the old one.</p>

<p>C++11 gives us the <code>auto</code> pointer for type deduction, similar to <code>var</code> in C#. Some examples:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c++'><span class='line'><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>                 <span class="c1">// x is int</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Thing</span><span class="p">();</span>       <span class="c1">// y is Thing*</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">const</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;the thing&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// z is a const char*</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>C++11 also has new loop syntax for iterators:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="k">auto</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="nl">value</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// prints 46033</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may notice in the above code the use of curly braces to initalize the std::vector. Braced initialization allows us to use a <code>std::initalizer_list</code> to initalize STL objects, but it also allows basic construction.</p>

<p>There are now lambdas: function handles defined dynamically which can capture other variables (called a closure).</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">my_func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 16</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above example, x is captured by reference. You could also copy-capture x by excluding the <code>&amp;</code>.</p>

<p>You like garbage collection? We got you covered. There&rsquo;s <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to represent one-shot memory that should be deleted when the pointer goes out of scope, and there&rsquo;s <code>std::shared_ptr</code> which is reference counted and will be deleted when all references to the shared_ptr go out of scope. These language enhancements are essential, and anyone well-versed in the usage of <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code> and <code>boost::shared_ptr</code> will have no trouble getting the hang of these.</p>

<p>The concurrency API is pretty neat, though I haven&rsquo;t had much chance to play with it. <code>std::atomic</code> allows you to create objects which are guaranteed to be read/write thread-safely. <code>std::future</code> allows you to fire off a command in another thread and continue after it&rsquo;s completion.</p>

<p>Looking to override a method? You can indicate an intentional override with the <code>override</code> keyword to tell the reader and the compiler you&rsquo;re intending to override a parent method. Comes in handy.</p>

<p>Another nice construct is <code>nullptr</code>. In C++, <code>NULL</code> is actually just 0. Because of this you might even see your fellow developers comparing pointers to 0 while you try to determine their intent. We can now compare and set our NULL pointers to <code>nullptr</code>: an improvement soft in functionality, but noticeable in readability.</p>

<p>Although I loved reading about C++ in bite-sized chunks throughout this book, there were a few things that went over my head (not just the first time). A major point of friction between myself and the author were universal references (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) and the <code>move</code> operator. These concepts were new to me and difficult to grasp the first few times they were brought up in this book. It may have been the order they were presented, or it may have been my lack of contact with them in the real world, but I would recommend having some level of understanding for universal references before reading those parts of this book.</p>

<p>The <code>move</code> operation moves the contents of memory from one object into another, as opposed to a copy operation which will duplicate that memory. A universal reference is, in some sense, a way to allow either a <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> to be called based on whether an lvalue or an rvalue is being passed in. There are lots of rules involved, and sometimes <code>move</code> is faster than <code>copy</code> but other times it isn&rsquo;t. For me (and I assume many others), this confusion will lead me to largely ignore this feature for now.</p>

<p>There is also quite a bit of discussion early in the book about using type deduction in templates with <code>auto</code> and <code>decltype</code>, but this discussion made my head hurt and made me glad I don&rsquo;t do much template metaprogramming.</p>

<p>On top of all this goodness (and more I didn&rsquo;t mention), C++14 includes a lot of bonus features that make C++ even a little sweeter. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14">shortlist</a>. (Looking for a list of C++11 features? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">Here you go</a>.)</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html">Thomas Becker&rsquo;s overview of universal references</a></li>
<li>Buy the <em>Effective</em> books missing from my collection</li>
<li>Keep coding with C++</li>
<li>Enable C++14 in a project</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you weren&rsquo;t paying close attention, you may not have noticed that Github has recently <a href="https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile">removed Streaks from profile pages</a> along with a few other changes.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Github tracked each user&rsquo;s commit history every day and displayed this information prominently on the user&rsquo;s profile for the past 365 days. When committing multiple days in succession, a &ldquo;streak&rdquo; is started. Your streak resets the next solar day you don&rsquo;t commit to Github.</p>

<p><strong>What was the purpose of the streak?</strong></p>

<p>The streak encouraged developers to contribute public open-source code as frequently as possible. This is a very good thing! Maybe it even influenced some people to contribute to open-source projects that desperately needed help. Maybe it helped some developers explore new codebases and languages they never dreamt of exploring previously.</p>

<p>However, any good feelings that came from the streak are instantly dashed when you take a day off. All those good-feels you get after working hard to get a 10-day streak? Crushed in an instant. Now you need to start over, but you don&rsquo;t bother because every time you feel a streak coming on it&rsquo;s dashed away. This is a painful reminder that life is short, and you&rsquo;ll only be rewarded in the short-term for any effort you put in.</p>

<p><strong>So if the good-feels wasn&rsquo;t the purpose, how about notoriety? Surely someone with a long streak is a good person and a noble developer!</strong></p>

<p>Except for <a href="https://gist.github.com/cirosantilli/4d24fc646ab9aec8def7">gists like this</a> which will help you generate a 100-year streak. Or the fact that you could make empty commits to personal repos and manipulate the streak. Or you could be making minor documentation/newline changes every day. Not only that, but not all developers use Github as their primary source control platform. Developers could be making contributions to Bitbucket as well as Github and not have that reflected in their streak at all.</p>

<p><strong>My theory is that streaks, though well-intended, served no purpose.</strong></p>

<p>They were ripe for abuse and not a very good &ldquo;reward&rdquo; for contributing code on the side, nor a good indicator of how grey a developer&rsquo;s beard is. Not all good developers make commits every day, and encouraging a commit-a-day is getting people trapped in the Silicon Valley bad-habit of never not working. For the time being, good riddance.</p>

<p>At Canonical, we use Launchpad to host most of our source code. Launchpad has this concept of &ldquo;Karma&rdquo; which tracks your commits, code reviews, bug reports, branch merges, etc on Launchpad. Karma decays over time but not immediately, which means that you can take days off and maintain Karma. From this number, you can usually tell if a user is new to the system, highly active recently, or has turned into a manager. For reference, mine is <a href="https://launchpad.net/~larryprice/+karma">a little over 3000</a> as of this blog post. Although I mostly like the way Karma works, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the epitome of source code gamification.</p>

<p>As far as I know, sites like Bitbucket and GitLab don&rsquo;t have such a concept of rewarding heavy coders or giving some indication of recent activity outside of a news feed. Maybe a news feed style is enough?</p>

<p>The good people at Github want you to code socially, and I&rsquo;m excited to see if they can come up with a fun and light way to gamify open-source software while avoiding some of the unfun aspects of streaks and the blaisé concept of news feeds.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you miss streaks? Did streaks motivate you to contribute more frequently? Any ideas for a new system? Tell me in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is the second in a series of blog posts detailing my experience migrating from a culture based on co-location to a fully remote environment. You may also enjoy my <a href="/blog/2016/04/11/going-remote-1-week/">original post detailing my first week</a>. Look out for another post in the fall.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent an entire month working remotely. Whereas I spent much of my first week working remotely getting my home office in a working state, the rest of the month was largely spent acclimating to a culture of complete autonomy, getting comfortable with my peers, and finding my way around.</p>

<h3>Attacking My Action Items</h3>

<p>One of my action items from <a href="/blog/2016/04/11/going-remote-1-week/">the week 1 post</a> involved personalizing my workspace. I brought three posters from our second-floor study and planted them on the walls of my new office area downstairs. It makes my new office feel a lot more like my own space and a lot less like the formerly-unused living room. I have a 1994 Ren&amp;Stimpy calendar hanging on the bookshelf as well as a few stickers and other various nerdy hangables. I&rsquo;m fairly happy with the current state of my office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a point of exercising more during the work day. I work my biceps and triceps with my handheld weight, as many nose-to-the-ground push-ups as I can, and really hard bicycles until my abs tell me to stop. I&rsquo;ve also been walking outside in the early afternoon to check on the state of my hop garden. Not to mention I&rsquo;m still making significant use of my sit-stand desk.</p>

<p>As far as extracurricular activities go, I think I&rsquo;m keeping steady. I&rsquo;ve been going to my local Code&amp;Coffee, and I just had a monthly meeting of Indy Golang. I&rsquo;ve been reading a bunch of blogs and eating up modern C++ material. I&rsquo;d like to make sure I get to IndySA every now and then, but I usually just whiff the date. I haven&rsquo;t been doing much coding outside of work, but that hasn&rsquo;t been high on my priority list recently. Since I currently work for an open-source company, I am embedded in the world of code all day, and I usually end the day very satisified.</p>

<p>I did not buy a better floormat. Still on the list.</p>

<h3>Acclimation Station</h3>

<p>Although my first week was a success, I&rsquo;ll admit it was still a little awkward. However, I&rsquo;ve found myself significantly more comfortable at the end of my first month.</p>

<p>In this position, there is a level of autonomy unlike any I have ever experienced. No one tells me what to work on next. I figure out what I&rsquo;ll be doing almost entirely based on incoming bug reports, community rumblings, nebulous plans, or simply things that interest and/or annoy me about a project. Priorities are in the eye of the beholder, and it&rsquo;s in my best interest to pick up work that is meaningful and relevant. I complete the task, get it into review, and make sure everybody&rsquo;s happy. Since everyone has a shared goal, it&rsquo;s unusual for developers to be especially nit-picky during reviews, and thus reviews become more focused on correctness, education, and mysterious edge cases.</p>

<p>Talking to people on IRC can be a little daunting because so many of my coworkers are just so good at it. At first, talking to the right people seemed impossible. Eventually, I&rsquo;ve learned to become efficient with my IRC usage and I have certain channels relevant to my current tasks where I hang out. Although I describe our communications as &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s not to say we don&rsquo;t joke around and have a good time. There are people I interact with every day who I consider work-friends even though we&rsquo;ve never spoken face-to-face.</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks we&rsquo;ve held two company-wide events. The first was a remote open forum with our CEO. During the remote forum, the CEO discussed how the company was doing and then she opened the floor for questions. Someone would ask a question in chat, people would vote for those questions, and then we would get an answer. It was done quite well and felt like a great introduction to the CEO and her vision for our company&rsquo;s future. This week was a three-day conference spanning the entire organization. Presenters would share their faces and slides using Hangouts on Air, while attendees watched live and chatted together in a relevant channel. I learned a lot about the wider scope and relevance of my project, and I also got to hear about all the other interesting things going on around the company. I got to hear the founder do a Q&amp;A, which gave rise to many great questions with humble, honest answers which gave me a good idea of what we are all about as an organization. Attendance was optional, so irrelevant presentations could be ignored as easily as closing a tab.</p>

<p>For the first couple weeks, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how some of my peers could be so busy all the time. Now I understand. I found myself working on projects several dependencies away from my own, adding features and fixing bugs such that our project could integrate with the dependency and we could get features shipped. Due to the nature of everything being open-source, I&rsquo;m constantly working with my peers to figure out where a bug might be stemming from or the appropriate level to inject a feature or even just who to talk to about how things work. You fix a bug in one project and accidentally become a contributor while the project is in desperate need of many code reviews, which you then do and become an even more relevant member to the team.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, traditional office workers will say things to me like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you work from home; I&rsquo;d just be distracted all day and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get anything done.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve found that to be completely untrue. There are many days where I have trouble not working in the evening. I&rsquo;ll read up on some modern C++ techniques or read some misguided blog post about our projects, and I&rsquo;ll think about jumping on the computer at 9pm just to take a peek. It takes a lot of self-restraint, but I&rsquo;ve thus far been pretty good about not working after work. Hopefully I can keep that up.</p>

<p>In a few weeks, my team is meeting in Montreal to hang out and do code for a week. I&rsquo;m excited for the opportunity to see everyone (not to mention to be in Montreal), and I&rsquo;m certain that it will help me feel even more acclimated to this new environment.</p>

<h3>Some New Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Better floormat</strong>. Standing on my plastic mat right now, my feet do start to hurt. I need to run to an office supply store and find some rubber padding.</li>
<li><strong>IRC Champion</strong>. Although I&rsquo;m more comfortable on IRC, I know I could be better about reaching out at the right times to the right people.</li>
<li><strong>Automaton</strong>. I still grope around for work when I&rsquo;m not sure what to do next. I&rsquo;d like to come up with a process to determine what should be next on the agenda without too much synchronous assistance.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interviews suck, amirite? Recently, there&rsquo;s been a rise in posts discussing how harmful whiteboard problems are. Let&rsquo;s chat about how the internet works, and then we&rsquo;ll discuss where I land on this issue.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got one group of people who love whiteboarding. Whiteboarding allows interviewers to see how a candidate thinks. Whiteboarding gives the illusion of programming without the fear of compiler errors. Solving a problem algorithmically on a whiteboard is the same as programming.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ve got the people who think whiteboarding during interviews is just as terrible as waterboarding a candidate. Whiteboard problems cause interviewers to become smug, sexist, and xenophobic. Candidates are forced to sweat bullets at a whiteboard while a death panel of interviewers silently judge them. Whiteboarding a programming problem is entirely different from computer programming.</p>

<p>Between you and me, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s all so black and white. Like most things in this world, whiteboarding falls into a somewhat uncomfortable grey area. There are certainly things which can be gained by whiteboarding, but it&rsquo;s also in no way indicative of programming strength or culture fit. There are literally classes teaching people how to be pro at whiteboarding.</p>

<p>One of the main problems is that this is not how you work in real life. You don&rsquo;t put together code on a whiteboard while a group of strangers stares intently waiting for you to screw up so they can mark points off your score. Your day is largely spent reading other people&rsquo;s code to figure out how you can force whatever new feature or bug fix you need to implement into their code as easily, quickly, and cleanly as possible, and then you&rsquo;re usually put into a position where you have to sacrifice the easy, quick, or clean part of that plan. Along the way, you usually get to fight the compiler or search the internet for any relevant APIs, StackOverflow questions, or existing libraries. You&rsquo;re probably also a member of a team with varying experience levels in the current codebase, so you&rsquo;ll spend another big part of your day asking/answering questions on group chat and gatekeeping the codebase from code that is unreadable, unchangeable, or just plain questionable via code reviews.</p>

<p>But if this is the way we do our jobs, why do we ask candidates to reimplement underscore&rsquo;s debounce function, create all the possible words from a telephone number, or generate roman numerals from an integer?</p>

<p>Some organizations have moved to systems of making the candidate solve a multi-hour problem in their free time, or come into the office and spend a day (or more) pairing with their future teammates. Although I think these ideas are founded on a solid base of logic, they are terrible. A large number of worthy candidates already have full-time jobs to deal with, and many of them have other commitments during the evening hours. The perfect candidate may have recently found themself with a new child, and every non-9-5 hour is no longer available to create a reverse binary tree. Adding more work and stress to an interview is not the right way to go.</p>

<p>How could we possibly find the perfect candidate without stressing them out and giving them standardized tests?</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s make them work like we do, but only for a reasonable amount of time.</strong> Come up with a medium-difficulty coding problem and <em>write it yourself</em>. But don&rsquo;t make it clean. <em>Make it sloppy</em>. Make <em>a ripe mess</em> of that code. Add an obvious bug or two.</p>

<p>Now, when you bring in an interviewer or talk to them on a video call, show them this code. <em>Can they figure out what it does</em>? <em>Can they find the bugs</em>? Ask them to code review it. <em>Do they see all the terrible things you&rsquo;ve done</em>? <em>Can they tell you how to make it better</em>? <em>Can they do it without being condescending</em> (news flash: most full-time programmers cannot do this)? This should all be a back-and-forth, with the (lone) interviewer working with the candidate to discuss any issues. If you have time, ask them to actually correct and refactor some of the code. If you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing, work with them to write some test cases for the bugs you&rsquo;ve fixed. If for some reason you still don&rsquo;t know whether or not you like this person, have them add some functionality to the codebase. Then code review their code and see how they handle your suggestions. <strong>You should limit this exercise to an hour</strong>, maybe two if you&rsquo;re a sadist. Do not make this an all day thing.</p>

<p>Think about how much you could get out of this exercise. You&rsquo;ll determine whether the candidate knows what code looks like, knows how to read code, knows how to communicate about code, and knows how to fix bad code. You&rsquo;ll also get a bit of their personality based on how mean they are during the code review sections. Hopefully, you were able to have a real discussion about design decisions and coding during the interview. The candidate will have done very little programming, just like you and me on a normal day. Best of all, you&rsquo;ll only have spent an hour of each other&rsquo;s time trying to figure out if the candidate is competent. Leave time for questions at the end and be done with it.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t currently run a tech company or do much with the interview process. But everyone&rsquo;s been giving their two cents on that issue, and I like to type words on the computer. What do you think? Is whiteboarding during an interview integral to your interview process? Do you need it? Do you hate it? Do you have any alternatives? Let me know in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I would like for this to be the first in a series of blog posts detailing my experience migrating from a culture based on co-location to a fully remote environment. Look out for another post at about the 1-month mark.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent an entire week working remotely. How did it go? I&rsquo;m not going to go into my current job here (if you&rsquo;re curious: I love it), but I&rsquo;m going to try to focus on the aspects of setting up a pleasant environment for working from home and how I coped during my first week.</p>

<h3>But first: some background</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never worked remotely as a professional software engineer for more than one day at a time until now. I&rsquo;ve been a part of an office with traditional cube farms and an office with more modern team spaces. I haven&rsquo;t worked in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ptone/status/582764080219320323">Silicon Valley Sweat Shop</a>, and I&rsquo;ve never had a private office with walls, windows, and that holy grail of office furniture: a door. My past organizations have been nested in a culture of co-location which is, of course, very normal. However, I&rsquo;ve very recently moved to a position at a new organization with cultural values borrowed from the open-source community. About 70% of the 700 employees are full remote.</p>

<p>When I use the term &ldquo;working remotely,&rdquo; I mean that a given employee works from wherever they want. For the majority of people it&rsquo;s their home or apartment, but it could also be a coffee shop, a co-working space, a public park, or anywhere with an internet connection and a nearby power source.</p>

<h3>Setting Up My (Physical) Environment</h3>

<p>Also known as <em>Things I Had to Buy to Make This Work</em>.</p>

<p>To prepare for this new work environment, I did what anyone would do: I started buying things. I bought a <a href="http://amzn.to/1Q3HywG">cool wireless mouse</a> that I could connect to my laptop through it&rsquo;s built-in bluetooth. I bought <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00103102/#/90289172">a chair with a name from IKEA</a> and one of those cheap plastic carpet protectors. I started looking into motorized sit/stand desks, but didn&rsquo;t purchase one immediately (a mistake I quickly recovered from). I moved a second lamp into my home office and figured I was set up for success.</p>

<p>My first day, poor Markus (the chair) cracked the floor protector in several places, and my carpet is so thick that the chair couldn&rsquo;t roll on its own. I painfully used my laptop&rsquo;s keyboard for about 15 minutes before finding <a href="http://amzn.to/1MqycR8">another mechanical keyboard</a> to use instead which arrived that afternoon. The height of my old desk made sitting for hours super uncomfortable, so I quickly put in an order for a <a href="https://www.myupdesk.com/">sit/stand desk</a> that I could use downstairs where the carpet is thinner.</p>

<p>The next day, my new mechanical keyboard refused to let me type Shift+RightAlt without thinking it was a Meta key, causing all my keyboard shortcuts to be busted. I swapped it out with my old mechanical keyboard that worked just as well, but with a functioning Shift+RightAlt. It was around this time I noticed my WiFi connection was becoming flaky. I cursed my ISP and decided it was fine for the time being.</p>

<p>At some point during the week, the sit/stand desk arrived. Because of the thick carpet and uneven floors upstairs, I decided to start creating my new office downstairs. Unfortunately, my house is extremely poorly lit, so at the end of the day I had to run out to Target to buy a <a href="http://www.target.com/p/threshold-torchiere-floor-lamp-with-alabaster-glass-shade-oil-rubbed-bronze/-/A-14580986">new lamp</a> (and some cream cheese! classic combo!).</p>

<p>By this time it was Friday. My network connection was not just bad, but worse than it ever had been. I started sniffing around the internets and found that <a href="https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wireless-products/dual-band-wireless-ac-7260-bluetooth.html">my wireless card</a> (a bluetooth/WiFi dual card) was notoriously bad at handling bluetooth and WiFi at the same time on Linux, but sometimes updating the kernel and getting the latest iwlwifi drivers fixed the problem. So I updated to 4.3. No luck, so I updated to 4.4. <em>Still no luck</em>. By the end of things, I had the 4.4.6 kernel and I honestly thought things were a little better. A few hours and a dropped Hangouts call later, I realized I was wrong. However, booting off of a USB with fresh Ubuntu gave me a consistent and fast network connection. After piddling around a bit, I dramatically smacked my forehead. I flipped off the bluetooth connection on my laptop, and my network connection was fast and stable. I had been thwarted by my beautiful bluetooth mouse which, fortunately for me, also came with the usual wireless USB dongle.</p>

<p>At the end of the week, I finally felt like my setup was fine. Network still a little slower than expected, but I fixed that recently by moving the router to higher ground.</p>

<h3>Let me count the ways&hellip;</h3>

<p>OK, so I had some issues getting my home office in working order. But <strong>I love working from home</strong>.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel rushed when I get out of bed in the morning. I shave, shower, make coffee in the french press, and perfectly toast/cheese my bagel; and I get to enjoy every minute of getting ready for the day. I start when I want, but when I want is a normal time. I&rsquo;m at my desk ready to do my job sometime between 7:30am and 8:30am. The only way I need to let people know I&rsquo;m in the office is by signing into chat.</p>

<p>My house is almost silent except for the noises I make and the infrequent meow of a cat wanting attention. I can focus on what I&rsquo;m doing without being distracted by peers or normal office noises. I don&rsquo;t need to put on headphones when I want solitude, which means I&rsquo;m not distracted by whatever noise is coming out of the headphones. Achieving flow seems to be much easier when there are fewer distractions.</p>

<p><em>Speaking of cats</em>&hellip; I know this will seem silly, but it&rsquo;s quite nice to have my feline companions hanging out with me all day. Usually they&rsquo;re taking naps nearby so I can say &ldquo;d'awwwwwwww&rdquo;, or they&rsquo;re waiting in the kitchen for me to get up so they can get pets. Go <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com/cat-adoption">adopt a cat</a> now.</p>

<p>I can make a healthy meal really easily at lunch. I love being able to pull some frozen veggies out of the freezer, throw them in the skillet with some sauce ingredients, add some protein, and feel like I&rsquo;m eating well in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>All of my communication comes through chat, email, and infrequent Hangouts. We mostly just use Hangouts for our daily standup, and it&rsquo;s a great way to see everyone&rsquo;s faces and feel like a team. Email is pretty much only used for mailing lists, such as new merge proposals, bug reports, and company news; so I only glance at my email a couple times a day, and mark whatever I don&rsquo;t care about as Done. We use Google services to do this, which means I&rsquo;m using Inbox to achieve zero-inbox. Chat is our primary means of communication. Being a remote group, the chat is extremely efficient. There are no graphic memes, and chats never end with &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get a conference room to hash this out.&rdquo; Information is constantly being exchanged through the chat, and I rarely feel dissatisfied with the outcome. It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that when you leave the chat, you do not get to know what happened in your absence. However, this does not seem to be a hindrance to anyone, but almost more of a relief. You don&rsquo;t need to be in-the-know 24/7 to know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<h3>Near-Future Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise more</strong>. Although my eating habits feel a little better, my exercise habits have been much worse. I used to meander the office every hour or two to get 10-15 minutes of exercise, or go outside to walk around. I have my sit/stand desk set up now, and I shuffle back and forth based on what I&rsquo;m doing and how my butt feels, but that doesn&rsquo;t count as exercise. I plan to lift my 10lb weights more frequently, and I&rsquo;d like to work out my core with push-ups and bicycles. It would also be great to walk around the neighborhood in the summer.</li>
<li><strong>Extracurricular</strong>. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve worked on something meaningful in the evenings, and it&rsquo;s been tough to get started on something since my work office (and computer) is now also my play office. In the next few weeks, I&rsquo;d like to build an Atom.io package to integrate with bzr.</li>
<li><strong>Personalize workspace</strong>. Since I&rsquo;ve taken over the living room, the decor is mostly a big, decorative clock. I have some wicked posters I&rsquo;d like to put up, but I need to convince my housemate that they won&rsquo;t look too tacky in such a guest-visible area.</li>
<li><strong>Find a better floormat</strong>. Like I said, this cheap IKEA floormat cracked on the first day. I&rsquo;d like to find something vinyl or closer to rubber that will be more resilient but also more comfortable when I morph into standing mode.</li>
</ul>
