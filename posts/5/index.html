  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thinking about writing an Ubuntu application that will work in Unity 8? You&rsquo;ll be writing a &ldquo;convergent&rdquo; app, which is an application that can respond to touch or mouse, and will adapt appropriately to a phone, tablet, or desktop screen. It will even be able to update its display on-the-fly if, say, you plug your phone into a monitor or bluetooth keyboard.</p>

<p>There are <em>lots</em> of ways to write a convergent application with the <a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/platform/sdk/">Ubuntu SDK</a>. You can build apps in pure QML, C++ with QML, QtQuick, pure HTML5/Javascript, or even <strong>Golang with QML</strong>. We&rsquo;ll be focusing on go apps for the rest of this post.</p>

<p>Go is a young language, and the recent release of <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.6">go 1.6</a> has introduced some nasty changes particularly involving cgo. It has also introduced vendoring by default, which is a welcome change.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using go 1.6.2. For me, the current project template provided by the Ubuntu SDK feels quite broken. I can&rsquo;t get things to build locally, and furthermore I see no options for pushing an ARM build to my device.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I found this <a href="https://github.com/nikwen/ubuntu-go-qml-template">ubuntu-go-qml-template</a> which is a template to enable running/building a go/qml application locally while also supporting building/installing onto an arm device. The kicker? This tool was designed to work for go 1.3.3. Sigh! Since I&rsquo;m unwilling to compromise and use old technology, I <a href="https://github.com/larryprice/ubuntu-go-qml-template">forked the project</a> and updated it to fit my more modern needs.</p>

<p>Because our go template will depend on QML, we depend on the <a href="https://github.com/go-qml/qml">go-qml</a> project to create the necessary C bindings to allow us to use QML. However, with the update to go 1.6, the current version (revision 2ee7e5f) of go-qml will give a runtime error from cgo with the wonderfully helpful <code>panic: runtime error: cgo argument has Go pointer to Go pointer</code>. Another thorn in our side. Fortunately, this issue is in previously tread-upon ground and there is a <a href="https://github.com/sjb/qml/tree/go1.6-port">fork of go-qml</a> with enough of the cgo issues fixed to run our application with no problems. In the <code>ubuntu-go-qml-template</code> I forked above, I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and vendored this fork of <code>go-qml</code>. It all works because of the default vendoring available in go 1.6.</p>

<p>With that background out of the way, let&rsquo;s run through getting a project started:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may need to have other dependencies including <code>click</code> or <code>phablet-tools</code>. The above commands installed dependencies, cloned the repo, and built and/or updated a chroot for building our source for arm.</p>

<p>Next you&rsquo;ll want to setup the project for your own needs. The original template creator included a nifty <code>setup</code> script to get this done:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ruby setup.rb -v -n your-project-name -a <span class="s2">&quot;Your Name&quot;</span> -e <span class="s2">&quot;your.email@example.com&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>                   -d <span class="s2">&quot;your-developer-namespace&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will do some fancy gsub and file renaming to make the template your own.</p>

<p>If you check <code>src/</code>, you&rsquo;ll find a <code>main.go</code> file ready for your use. You&rsquo;ll also find a <code>main.qml</code> file in <code>share/qml/</code>. You can vendor all of your dependencies in <code>vendor/</code>, where you&rsquo;ll already find the <code>qml</code> package.</p>

<p>As far as getting your application to work, there are more scripts available:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./build.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># this will build your project locally</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./run.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># this will build your project locally and then run it on the desktop</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The best part about this template is the ability to build for arm and load your applications onto a device:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./build-in-chroot.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># builds the package using the vivid+armhf chroot we set up previously</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>./install-on-device.sh
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># builds for vivid+armhf and installs the click directly on</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># the first USB-connected Ubuntu Touch device</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can run and install go/qml applications on desktop or on devices. Time to go build something cool!</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: In the future, this template will likely need to be updated for new go versions or new default versions of the Ubuntu SDK. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make a comment below or submit a PR.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Gist</h3>

<p>How can one man give the world so much? Scott Meyers transformed my understanding of C++ with <a href="/blog/2013/07/16/effective-c-plus-plus/"><em>Effective C++</em></a>, a book which not only teaches good C++ practices and principles, but also explains what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes to make those efforts so effectual. <a href="http://amzn.to/29dU9FO"><em>Effective Modern C++</em></a> is the same book aimed at a different audience. The audience of <em>Effective C++</em> was the developer who could use C++ to build a humble home of straw or wood, but didn&rsquo;t know that C++ was born to create homes of brick and mortar. <em>Effective Modern C++</em> is for the seasoned developer who knows the brick home they built with C++98 can stand tall, but is bewildered by the plethora of modern amenities available in the top-floor penthouse that is C++11.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>Even when first introduced to the language, it seemed the mentality around C++ was that it was simple, baremetal, and robust. It didn&rsquo;t need garbage collection. It didn&rsquo;t need decent threading (fork that). Lambdas? Type deduction? Go talk to a language specification who cares!</p>

<p>But here we are. C++11 can now act a little bit more like its cousins C# and Java, but run fast like its pappy C. I have been on a number of projects where C++11 is king for the last 3 months. The last time I had been on a C++ project, we seemed to be stuck in the ice age. As I first started reading this book, I would read one of the items and apply it directly to the code I was working on literally the following morning. This new C++ is downright <em>luxurious</em> compared to the old one.</p>

<p>C++11 gives us the <code>auto</code> pointer for type deduction, similar to <code>var</code> in C#. Some examples:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c++'><span class='line'><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>                 <span class="c1">// x is int</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Thing</span><span class="p">();</span>       <span class="c1">// y is Thing*</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">const</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;the thing&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// z is a const char*</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>C++11 also has new loop syntax for iterators:</p>

<p>You may notice in the above code the use of curly braces to initalize the std::vector. Braced initialization allows us to use a <code>std::initalizer_list</code> to initalize STL objects, but it also allows basic construction.</p>

<p>There are now lambdas: function handles defined dynamically which can capture other variables (called a closure).</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above example, x is captured by reference. You could also copy-capture x by excluding the <code>&amp;</code>.</p>

<p>You like garbage collection? We got you covered. There&rsquo;s <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to represent one-shot memory that should be deleted when the pointer goes out of scope, and there&rsquo;s <code>std::shared_ptr</code> which is reference counted and will be deleted when all references to the shared_ptr go out of scope. These language enhancements are essential, and anyone well-versed in the usage of <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code> and <code>boost::shared_ptr</code> will have no trouble getting the hang of these.</p>

<p>The concurrency API is pretty neat, though I haven&rsquo;t had much chance to play with it. <code>std::atomic</code> allows you to create objects which are guaranteed to be read/write thread-safely. <code>std::future</code> allows you to fire off a command in another thread and continue after it&rsquo;s completion.</p>

<p>Looking to override a method? You can indicate an intentional override with the <code>override</code> keyword to tell the reader and the compiler you&rsquo;re intending to override a parent method. Comes in handy.</p>

<p>Another nice construct is <code>nullptr</code>. In C++, <code>NULL</code> is actually just 0. Because of this you might even see your fellow developers comparing pointers to 0 while you try to determine their intent. We can now compare and set our NULL pointers to <code>nullptr</code>: an improvement soft in functionality, but noticeable in readability.</p>

<p>Although I loved reading about C++ in bite-sized chunks throughout this book, there were a few things that went over my head (not just the first time). A major point of friction between myself and the author were universal references (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) and the <code>move</code> operator. These concepts were new to me and difficult to grasp the first few times they were brought up in this book. It may have been the order they were presented, or it may have been my lack of contact with them in the real world, but I would recommend having some level of understanding for universal references before reading those parts of this book.</p>

<p>The <code>move</code> operation moves the contents of memory from one object into another, as opposed to a copy operation which will duplicate that memory. A universal reference is, in some sense, a way to allow either a <code>copy</code> or <code>move</code> to be called based on whether an lvalue or an rvalue is being passed in. There are lots of rules involved, and sometimes <code>move</code> is faster than <code>copy</code> but other times it isn&rsquo;t. For me (and I assume many others), this confusion will lead me to largely ignore this feature for now.</p>

<p>There is also quite a bit of discussion early in the book about using type deduction in templates with <code>auto</code> and <code>decltype</code>, but this discussion made my head hurt and made me glad I don&rsquo;t do much template metaprogramming.</p>

<p>On top of all this goodness (and more I didn&rsquo;t mention), C++14 includes a lot of bonus features that make C++ even a little sweeter. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14">shortlist</a>. (Looking for a list of C++11 features? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">Here you go</a>.)</p>

<h3>Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html">Thomas Becker&rsquo;s overview of universal references</a></li>
<li>Buy the <em>Effective</em> books missing from my collection</li>
<li>Keep coding with C++</li>
<li>Enable C++14 in a project</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you weren&rsquo;t paying close attention, you may not have noticed that Github has recently <a href="https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile">removed Streaks from profile pages</a> along with a few other changes.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Github tracked each user&rsquo;s commit history every day and displayed this information prominently on the user&rsquo;s profile for the past 365 days. When committing multiple days in succession, a &ldquo;streak&rdquo; is started. Your streak resets the next solar day you don&rsquo;t commit to Github.</p>

<p><strong>What was the purpose of the streak?</strong></p>

<p>The streak encouraged developers to contribute public open-source code as frequently as possible. This is a very good thing! Maybe it even influenced some people to contribute to open-source projects that desperately needed help. Maybe it helped some developers explore new codebases and languages they never dreamt of exploring previously.</p>

<p>However, any good feelings that came from the streak are instantly dashed when you take a day off. All those good-feels you get after working hard to get a 10-day streak? Crushed in an instant. Now you need to start over, but you don&rsquo;t bother because every time you feel a streak coming on it&rsquo;s dashed away. This is a painful reminder that life is short, and you&rsquo;ll only be rewarded in the short-term for any effort you put in.</p>

<p><strong>So if the good-feels wasn&rsquo;t the purpose, how about notoriety? Surely someone with a long streak is a good person and a noble developer!</strong></p>

<p>Except for <a href="https://gist.github.com/cirosantilli/4d24fc646ab9aec8def7">gists like this</a> which will help you generate a 100-year streak. Or the fact that you could make empty commits to personal repos and manipulate the streak. Or you could be making minor documentation/newline changes every day. Not only that, but not all developers use Github as their primary source control platform. Developers could be making contributions to Bitbucket as well as Github and not have that reflected in their streak at all.</p>

<p><strong>My theory is that streaks, though well-intended, served no purpose.</strong></p>

<p>They were ripe for abuse and not a very good &ldquo;reward&rdquo; for contributing code on the side, nor a good indicator of how grey a developer&rsquo;s beard is. Not all good developers make commits every day, and encouraging a commit-a-day is getting people trapped in the Silicon Valley bad-habit of never not working. For the time being, good riddance.</p>

<p>At Canonical, we use Launchpad to host most of our source code. Launchpad has this concept of &ldquo;Karma&rdquo; which tracks your commits, code reviews, bug reports, branch merges, etc on Launchpad. Karma decays over time but not immediately, which means that you can take days off and maintain Karma. From this number, you can usually tell if a user is new to the system, highly active recently, or has turned into a manager. For reference, mine is <a href="https://launchpad.net/~larryprice/+karma">a little over 3000</a> as of this blog post. Although I mostly like the way Karma works, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the epitome of source code gamification.</p>

<p>As far as I know, sites like Bitbucket and GitLab don&rsquo;t have such a concept of rewarding heavy coders or giving some indication of recent activity outside of a news feed. Maybe a news feed style is enough?</p>

<p>The good people at Github want you to code socially, and I&rsquo;m excited to see if they can come up with a fun and light way to gamify open-source software while avoiding some of the unfun aspects of streaks and the blaisé concept of news feeds.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you miss streaks? Did streaks motivate you to contribute more frequently? Any ideas for a new system? Tell me in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is the second in a series of blog posts detailing my experience migrating from a culture based on co-location to a fully remote environment. You may also enjoy my <a href="/blog/2016/04/11/going-remote-1-week/">original post detailing my first week</a>. Look out for another post in the fall.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent an entire month working remotely. Whereas I spent much of my first week working remotely getting my home office in a working state, the rest of the month was largely spent acclimating to a culture of complete autonomy, getting comfortable with my peers, and finding my way around.</p>

<h3>Attacking My Action Items</h3>

<p>One of my action items from <a href="/blog/2016/04/11/going-remote-1-week/">the week 1 post</a> involved personalizing my workspace. I brought three posters from our second-floor study and planted them on the walls of my new office area downstairs. It makes my new office feel a lot more like my own space and a lot less like the formerly-unused living room. I have a 1994 Ren&amp;Stimpy calendar hanging on the bookshelf as well as a few stickers and other various nerdy hangables. I&rsquo;m fairly happy with the current state of my office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a point of exercising more during the work day. I work my biceps and triceps with my handheld weight, as many nose-to-the-ground push-ups as I can, and really hard bicycles until my abs tell me to stop. I&rsquo;ve also been walking outside in the early afternoon to check on the state of my hop garden. Not to mention I&rsquo;m still making significant use of my sit-stand desk.</p>

<p>As far as extracurricular activities go, I think I&rsquo;m keeping steady. I&rsquo;ve been going to my local Code&amp;Coffee, and I just had a monthly meeting of Indy Golang. I&rsquo;ve been reading a bunch of blogs and eating up modern C++ material. I&rsquo;d like to make sure I get to IndySA every now and then, but I usually just whiff the date. I haven&rsquo;t been doing much coding outside of work, but that hasn&rsquo;t been high on my priority list recently. Since I currently work for an open-source company, I am embedded in the world of code all day, and I usually end the day very satisified.</p>

<p>I did not buy a better floormat. Still on the list.</p>

<h3>Acclimation Station</h3>

<p>Although my first week was a success, I&rsquo;ll admit it was still a little awkward. However, I&rsquo;ve found myself significantly more comfortable at the end of my first month.</p>

<p>In this position, there is a level of autonomy unlike any I have ever experienced. No one tells me what to work on next. I figure out what I&rsquo;ll be doing almost entirely based on incoming bug reports, community rumblings, nebulous plans, or simply things that interest and/or annoy me about a project. Priorities are in the eye of the beholder, and it&rsquo;s in my best interest to pick up work that is meaningful and relevant. I complete the task, get it into review, and make sure everybody&rsquo;s happy. Since everyone has a shared goal, it&rsquo;s unusual for developers to be especially nit-picky during reviews, and thus reviews become more focused on correctness, education, and mysterious edge cases.</p>

<p>Talking to people on IRC can be a little daunting because so many of my coworkers are just so good at it. At first, talking to the right people seemed impossible. Eventually, I&rsquo;ve learned to become efficient with my IRC usage and I have certain channels relevant to my current tasks where I hang out. Although I describe our communications as &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s not to say we don&rsquo;t joke around and have a good time. There are people I interact with every day who I consider work-friends even though we&rsquo;ve never spoken face-to-face.</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks we&rsquo;ve held two company-wide events. The first was a remote open forum with our CEO. During the remote forum, the CEO discussed how the company was doing and then she opened the floor for questions. Someone would ask a question in chat, people would vote for those questions, and then we would get an answer. It was done quite well and felt like a great introduction to the CEO and her vision for our company&rsquo;s future. This week was a three-day conference spanning the entire organization. Presenters would share their faces and slides using Hangouts on Air, while attendees watched live and chatted together in a relevant channel. I learned a lot about the wider scope and relevance of my project, and I also got to hear about all the other interesting things going on around the company. I got to hear the founder do a Q&amp;A, which gave rise to many great questions with humble, honest answers which gave me a good idea of what we are all about as an organization. Attendance was optional, so irrelevant presentations could be ignored as easily as closing a tab.</p>

<p>For the first couple weeks, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how some of my peers could be so busy all the time. Now I understand. I found myself working on projects several dependencies away from my own, adding features and fixing bugs such that our project could integrate with the dependency and we could get features shipped. Due to the nature of everything being open-source, I&rsquo;m constantly working with my peers to figure out where a bug might be stemming from or the appropriate level to inject a feature or even just who to talk to about how things work. You fix a bug in one project and accidentally become a contributor while the project is in desperate need of many code reviews, which you then do and become an even more relevant member to the team.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, traditional office workers will say things to me like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you work from home; I&rsquo;d just be distracted all day and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get anything done.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve found that to be completely untrue. There are many days where I have trouble not working in the evening. I&rsquo;ll read up on some modern C++ techniques or read some misguided blog post about our projects, and I&rsquo;ll think about jumping on the computer at 9pm just to take a peek. It takes a lot of self-restraint, but I&rsquo;ve thus far been pretty good about not working after work. Hopefully I can keep that up.</p>

<p>In a few weeks, my team is meeting in Montreal to hang out and do code for a week. I&rsquo;m excited for the opportunity to see everyone (not to mention to be in Montreal), and I&rsquo;m certain that it will help me feel even more acclimated to this new environment.</p>

<h3>Some New Action Items</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Better floormat</strong>. Standing on my plastic mat right now, my feet do start to hurt. I need to run to an office supply store and find some rubber padding.</li>
<li><strong>IRC Champion</strong>. Although I&rsquo;m more comfortable on IRC, I know I could be better about reaching out at the right times to the right people.</li>
<li><strong>Automaton</strong>. I still grope around for work when I&rsquo;m not sure what to do next. I&rsquo;d like to come up with a process to determine what should be next on the agenda without too much synchronous assistance.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interviews suck, amirite? Recently, there&rsquo;s been a rise in posts discussing how harmful whiteboard problems are. Let&rsquo;s chat about how the internet works, and then we&rsquo;ll discuss where I land on this issue.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got one group of people who love whiteboarding. Whiteboarding allows interviewers to see how a candidate thinks. Whiteboarding gives the illusion of programming without the fear of compiler errors. Solving a problem algorithmically on a whiteboard is the same as programming.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ve got the people who think whiteboarding during interviews is just as terrible as waterboarding a candidate. Whiteboard problems cause interviewers to become smug, sexist, and xenophobic. Candidates are forced to sweat bullets at a whiteboard while a death panel of interviewers silently judge them. Whiteboarding a programming problem is entirely different from computer programming.</p>

<p>Between you and me, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s all so black and white. Like most things in this world, whiteboarding falls into a somewhat uncomfortable grey area. There are certainly things which can be gained by whiteboarding, but it&rsquo;s also in no way indicative of programming strength or culture fit. There are literally classes teaching people how to be pro at whiteboarding.</p>

<p>One of the main problems is that this is not how you work in real life. You don&rsquo;t put together code on a whiteboard while a group of strangers stares intently waiting for you to screw up so they can mark points off your score. Your day is largely spent reading other people&rsquo;s code to figure out how you can force whatever new feature or bug fix you need to implement into their code as easily, quickly, and cleanly as possible, and then you&rsquo;re usually put into a position where you have to sacrifice the easy, quick, or clean part of that plan. Along the way, you usually get to fight the compiler or search the internet for any relevant APIs, StackOverflow questions, or existing libraries. You&rsquo;re probably also a member of a team with varying experience levels in the current codebase, so you&rsquo;ll spend another big part of your day asking/answering questions on group chat and gatekeeping the codebase from code that is unreadable, unchangeable, or just plain questionable via code reviews.</p>

<p>But if this is the way we do our jobs, why do we ask candidates to reimplement underscore&rsquo;s debounce function, create all the possible words from a telephone number, or generate roman numerals from an integer?</p>

<p>Some organizations have moved to systems of making the candidate solve a multi-hour problem in their free time, or come into the office and spend a day (or more) pairing with their future teammates. Although I think these ideas are founded on a solid base of logic, they are terrible. A large number of worthy candidates already have full-time jobs to deal with, and many of them have other commitments during the evening hours. The perfect candidate may have recently found themself with a new child, and every non-9-5 hour is no longer available to create a reverse binary tree. Adding more work and stress to an interview is not the right way to go.</p>

<p>How could we possibly find the perfect candidate without stressing them out and giving them standardized tests?</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s make them work like we do, but only for a reasonable amount of time.</strong> Come up with a medium-difficulty coding problem and <em>write it yourself</em>. But don&rsquo;t make it clean. <em>Make it sloppy</em>. Make <em>a ripe mess</em> of that code. Add an obvious bug or two.</p>

<p>Now, when you bring in an interviewer or talk to them on a video call, show them this code. <em>Can they figure out what it does</em>? <em>Can they find the bugs</em>? Ask them to code review it. <em>Do they see all the terrible things you&rsquo;ve done</em>? <em>Can they tell you how to make it better</em>? <em>Can they do it without being condescending</em> (news flash: most full-time programmers cannot do this)? This should all be a back-and-forth, with the (lone) interviewer working with the candidate to discuss any issues. If you have time, ask them to actually correct and refactor some of the code. If you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing, work with them to write some test cases for the bugs you&rsquo;ve fixed. If for some reason you still don&rsquo;t know whether or not you like this person, have them add some functionality to the codebase. Then code review their code and see how they handle your suggestions. <strong>You should limit this exercise to an hour</strong>, maybe two if you&rsquo;re a sadist. Do not make this an all day thing.</p>

<p>Think about how much you could get out of this exercise. You&rsquo;ll determine whether the candidate knows what code looks like, knows how to read code, knows how to communicate about code, and knows how to fix bad code. You&rsquo;ll also get a bit of their personality based on how mean they are during the code review sections. Hopefully, you were able to have a real discussion about design decisions and coding during the interview. The candidate will have done very little programming, just like you and me on a normal day. Best of all, you&rsquo;ll only have spent an hour of each other&rsquo;s time trying to figure out if the candidate is competent. Leave time for questions at the end and be done with it.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t currently run a tech company or do much with the interview process. But everyone&rsquo;s been giving their two cents on that issue, and I like to type words on the computer. What do you think? Is whiteboarding during an interview integral to your interview process? Do you need it? Do you hate it? Do you have any alternatives? Let me know in the comments.</p>
