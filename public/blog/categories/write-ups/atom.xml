<strong>Spencer Johnson</strong></p>

<h3>The Gist</h3>

<p><em>Who Moved My Cheese?</em> is a book about being prepared to lose your job. The book was written during times of rapid economic growth caused by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_boom">dot-com bubble</a>, which resulted in many companies emerging out of the primordial ooze and then falling back down into the tarpit after an extremely short time on the market. The author uses a cute analogy about cheese to convey that success is fleeting, and each day could be the day a company will shut down.</p>

<h3>My Feelings</h3>

<p>This is another book I read during summer 2012 and wrote a mediocre write-up regarding. This write-up is fresh and in my new write-up style.</p>

<p>The authors of this book want to help people realize that their job is a gift, not a privilage. Just because a company is doing well this quarter does not imply that it will still be in business next quarter. During the time period this book was written in, this was especially true. The theory of companies during the late '90s was to spend as much money as possible to gather as many customers as possible disregarding profits in the short-term (read: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html">Get Large or Get Lost</a>). Of course, this kind of mentality did not fit all businesses, and many companies which looked like they would be the future leaders of the American economy were quickly forgotten by the mid-2000s (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com">Pets.com</a>).</p>

<p>The authors want employees to stop fearing change, and to accept it as a normal part of life. Sometimes companies falter, and oftentimes there's nothing an individual can do about it. In doing so, sometimes old friends are left behind while an individual moves on in search of bigger and better things. Sometimes it takes a long time to find those bigger and better things, but every time it's worth it due to the thrill of confronting your fears and exploring something new.</p>

<p>The use of a "maze" with two tiny people and two anthropomorphic mice is strange and feels purposefully forced. The authors wanted to make a memorable anecdote, and they succeeded with their strange analogy. Having said that, several times I was confused by the names of the four characters as they were very similar and nonsensical. Because of this, I had to reread some sections after referencing the first page of the book to determine who was who.</p>

<p>The primary author appended "MD" to his name on the front cover. Similarly, the "secondary" author appended a "PhD" to his name on the front cover. This bothered me as it is an obvious ploy to make people value the opinions held within the book more highly because they are written by "doctors."</p>

<h3>Who Would Like This</h3>

<p>This is a book that tries to prepare people for the worst and to teach them not to just give up when the future looks grim. It could be an interesting book for anyone, especially after several years of an economic boom caused by a new technology. A person who is very content in their current position at a company could also benefit from this book, as it may give them some incentive to seek out change.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development-Pragmatic/dp/1934356344/"><strong>The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</strong></a><br/>
<strong>Chad Fowler</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>The Gist</h3>

<p>This book tells the story of Chad Fowler (no relation to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>). Fowler got himself into a software development slump and was able to turn it around and rejuvinate his passion for his career. Much of the book revolves around how to keep oneself engaged with one's work and how to determine when it's time to shake things up.</p>

<h3>My Feelings</h3>

<p>I read this book in Summer 2012 and did a mediocre write-up on my old blog, so I've decided to quickly redo the write-up from scratch using my new format.</p>

<p>What Fowler talks about in his book is exactly what I was afraid of when looking for a job last fall: getting stuck. It's easy to do: many employers are looking for employees who are willing to work on projects throughout their entire lifespan, which may be 12 months, 5 years or in some cases the lifespan of the company.</p>

<p>Personal story time. I was offered a job at an Indianapolis company with many long-term projects. One of my interviewers had been working on his current project for 5 years, and was trying desparately to get out of it. However, based on his seniority and domain knowledge of the project, he was told it would be at least another 6 months before he could move on. The developer was miserable working his current job and had no exit routes available to him, which scared me quite a bit.</p>

<p>Fowler's methods don't describe how to avoid this situation. They describe how to keep yourself happy by learning new technology and branching away from your "domain knowledge" while still remaining the go-to guy on your current project. Showing an interest in doing things outside of your current project should show an employer that you're capable of more, and that you're more than willing to do something new.</p>

<p>Fowler also talks about moving jobs if you're unhappy, noting that the new world of software development doesn't offer all the bells and whistles that it used to. Although I agree that you should try to find a new job if you're unhappy, it's not always as easy to pack up your things and move as the author makes it seem.</p>

<p>The coolest parts of the book were the personal stories of several high-tech big-wigs. The silliest parts were the 'Act On It' sections. The 'Act On It' sections described how to implement some of the methods detailed in the book, but they often seemed obvious and unnecessary to me.</p>

<h3>Who Would Like This</h3>

<p>This book can offer a lot to someone who wants to revitalize their career after getting in a rut. It may also be able to serve as a guide to preventing yourself from getting in a rut. As a recent college grad with many of my dreams still alive, I only found a moderate amount of honey in this beehive. An interesting read, but maybe not entirely relevant to fresh faces.</p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Linux-Works-Superuser-Should/dp/1593270356/"><strong>How Linux Works: Things Every Superuser Should Know</strong></a><br/>
<strong>Brian Ward</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3>The Gist</h3>

<p>Linux is a complicated operating system which gives its users the freedom to do anything. This book details things that any Linux superuser should be aware of, including printing, networking, scripting, compiling source code, setting up users, and buying hardware.</p>

<h3>My Feelings</h3>

<p>I've been running <a href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as the only operating system on my home computer since the 11.04 Natty Narwhal release in 2011, and I've been using Ubuntu in varying degrees since 9.04 Lucid Lynx. I've also recently ported my wife's computer over to Ubuntu after she finally got fed up with Linux. There is a course at Purdue called ECE364 that taught us lots of cool Linux commands which I had forgotten, so I've been looking for a good refresher. This book helped jog my memory of things like grep, sed, and awk. The book also provided lots of information on things that I'd been using for years without really realizing what I was doing.</p>

<p>This book was written in 2004, which was a long time ago in the computing world. In 2004, Ubuntu Linux (<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/254516/which_linux_distro_is_fairest_of_them_all_ubuntu_survey_says.html">the most popular personal desktop Linux distribution</a>) was released. Ward makes mentions of setting up network interfaces, firewalls, and printers through the terminal, which are all things that now are either done automatically by most operating systems or at a minimum have a GUI to support setup. Ward also mentions that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">CRT monitors</a> are on the cheap, but if you want the best resolution an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lcd">LCD monitor</a> is the new cool thang. He talks about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium">Pentium processors</a>, half gigabytes of DDR, and slow, heavy laptops. Be warned that you won't find anything in this book about 64-bit processors, SSDs, or cloud computing.</p>

<p>Most of the book is still very relevant. As mentioned previously, I got a lot of benefit from reading the section on common commands. The section on setting up dot-files was also extremely useful for me. There was also a lot of interesting information about the Linux filesystem being databases that I had never really thought about before.</p>

<h3>Who Would Like This</h3>

<p>Those new to Linux or those needing a refresher would benefit from scanning this book, at least the interesting sections. This book is not for people looking for bleeding-edge information on their new hardware or software. The reader can get a large amount of information that has aged well and will continue to be relevant for Linux users for years to come.</p>
