At the end of 2015, I published a video course on getting started with web development in Go. For the next two weeks, you can get it for 50% off using this link: [http://bit.ly/1PEubnd](http://bit.ly/1PEubnd). With over 2 hours of content for just over $20, it's a great deal. The sale runs from 21 Jan until 4 Feb 2016.

The video takes the student through every step of creating a personal library web application from scratch, covering concepts such as routing, database access, and authentication. It's a great introduction to go, and an excellent primer to starting your own go-based web project.

All this comes with the added benefit of supporting me: your local developer. :)
