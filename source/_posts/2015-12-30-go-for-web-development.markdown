I have published a video series on building web applications in Go called _[Go for Web Development](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/go-web-development-video)_.

These videos will guide you through the entire process of creating a web application in Go, all the way from spinning up a basic web server to multi-user authentication. In the end, you'll learn how to vendor dependencies and deploy the application to heroku. Throughout the course, you'll learn to utilize many of the most popular go packages including gorilla/mux, negroni, gorp, ace, and bcrypt. You'll learn about making asynchronous requests from the browser back to the web server, and you'll learn to access external REST APIs from your web server. You'll use go's struct tags to parse both XML and JSON, and you'll use struct tags to access database entities with gorp.

I spent many late nights creating this course, and I've learned a lot of lessons about creating screencasts along the way. I was also able to solidify much of my base understanding of the go language and learn about many features I don't often utilize. The videos are published by Packt Publishing, and they were a great help along the way. The most valuable lesson I learned from doing these screencasts is that a quality microphone makes a huge difference, and I would have saved myself a lot of trouble had I used my Rock Band microphone from the beginning. In the end everything turned out great. I'm relieved to be finished and excited to have an official ISBN connected to my name.

<s>The video is currently only $5 for the holidays, but</s> the regular retail price is set to $75 (which is still a bargain considering all the content).
