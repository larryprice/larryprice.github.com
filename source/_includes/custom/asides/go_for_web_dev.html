  <h1>Go for Web Development</h1>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/go-web-development-video" target="blank">Go for Web Development</a></strong> is an online video series designed by me where you'll follow along to build a personal library app in Go. You'll start with a blank slate but quickly learn to take advantage of popular libraries such as gorilla/mux, negroni, gorp, ace, and bcrypt.</p>
